# Blog Post Formatting and Navigation

## Front Matter
All blog posts must include:
```yaml
---
title: "Title in Quotes"
description: "Description in Quotes"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: Mike Levin
group: blog
---
```

## Navigation
- Navigation is automatically handled by the Jekyll template
- Posts are sorted by date and `sort_order`
- Previous/Next links appear at top and bottom of posts
- Blog index link is always available
- Post counter shows position in series
- No need to manually add navigation links

## Content Structure
- Start with a hook that speaks directly to the reader's experience
- Use clear section headers (##)
- Include practical examples and use cases
- End with a clear call to action or teaser for the next post
- Keep paragraphs short and scannable
- Use bullet points for lists of features/benefits

## Code Examples
- Use triple backticks with language specification
- Include comments explaining key concepts
- Keep examples focused and practical

## Linking
- Internal links should use relative paths
- External links should open in new tabs
- Use descriptive anchor text

## Images
- Place images in `/assets/images/blog/`
- Use descriptive alt text
- Include captions where helpful

## SEO Best Practices
- Use descriptive titles and meta descriptions
- Include relevant keywords naturally
- Structure content with proper heading hierarchy
- Keep URLs clean and descriptive
