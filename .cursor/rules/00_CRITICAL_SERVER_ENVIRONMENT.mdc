# üö® CRITICAL: Server and Environment Rules

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER RESTART THE SERVER ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THE SERVER IS ON WATCHDOG AND AUTOMATICALLY RELOADS!**

- **NEVER** run `pkill -f "python server.py"`
- **NEVER** stop or restart `python server.py`
- **NEVER** manually start/stop the server
- File changes trigger automatic reloads
- Just make changes and test immediately at `http://localhost:5001`

## üîß Nix Environment Requirements

**ALWAYS use the Nix development environment:**

```bash
# From within /home/mike/repos/pipulate directory:
nix develop .#quiet
```

**Critical Facts:**
- This is a **Nix flake** environment
- Working directory: `/home/mike/repos/pipulate`
- Server runs automatically on watchdog
- All dependencies managed through Nix

## üö´ What NOT to Do

- Don't try to install packages with pip/conda
- Don't restart the server manually
- Don't run commands outside the Nix environment
- Don't assume standard Python environment patterns

## ‚úÖ What TO Do

- Use `nix develop .#quiet` for development shell
- Make file changes and test immediately
- Trust the watchdog to handle reloads
- Work within the established Nix flake structure
