# PrismJS Widget Styling

## Line Number Alignment
The `Code` component must have these style attributes for proper line number alignment:
```python
style="position: relative; white-space: inherit; padding: 0 0 0 0;"
```

## Best Practices
1. Use FastHTML's native style attributes instead of raw CSS injection
2. Keep styling minimal and focused on alignment requirements
3. Avoid overriding Prism's default syntax highlighting styles

## Common Issues
- Line numbers misaligned with code: Ensure padding is set to 0
- Syntax highlighting not working: Check language class is correctly set
- Widget not initializing: Verify Prism.js is loaded before initialization
