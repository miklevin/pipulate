# Pipulate Workflow Key System

## 1. Overview

Each run of a Pipulate workflow is identified by a unique "pipeline key" (or `pipeline_id`). This key is central to state management, allowing workflows to be interruptible and resumable.

## 2. CRITICAL: Auto-Key Generation Pattern

**THE MOST IMPORTANT PATTERN THAT LLMs CONSISTENTLY MISS:**

When a user hits Enter on an empty key field, this specific sequence occurs:

1. **Form Submission**: POSTs to `/{APP_NAME}/init` with empty `pipeline_id`
2. **Server Response**: The `init` method MUST return an `HX-Refresh` response:
   ```python
   if not user_input:
       from starlette.responses import Response
       response = Response('')
       response.headers['HX-Refresh'] = 'true'
       return response
   ```
3. **Page Reload**: HTMX triggers a full page reload
4. **Auto-Key Population**: The `landing()` method calls `pip.generate_pipeline_key(self)` to populate the input field
5. **User Interaction**: User hits Enter again to start the workflow

**Critical Implementation Details:**
- The `_onfocus='this.setSelectionRange(this.value.length, this.value.length)'` attribute positions cursor at end
- This allows users to easily modify the suggested key
- The pattern ensures predictable, sequential key generation

## 3. Key Structure & Generation

  * **Format (Convention)**: `{ProfileName}-{WorkflowAppName}-{RunNumber}`
      * Example: `Default_Profile-Hello_Workflow-01`
  * **Components**:
      * `ProfileName`: The currently active user profile (e.g., `Default_Profile`).
      * `WorkflowAppName`: The `APP_NAME` of the workflow (e.g., `Hello_Workflow`). Note: this is the internal `APP_NAME` constant from the workflow class, not necessarily derived from the filename.
      * `RunNumber`: A zero-padded sequential number (e.g., `01`, `02`, ... `99`, `100`).
  * **Auto-Generation**:
      * **On landing page**: `pipulate.generate_pipeline_key(self_instance, user_input=None)` suggests the next available key for the current profile and workflow.
      * **`init` method**: If the user submits an empty key from the landing page, `init` typically calls `generate_pipeline_key` to create a new one.
      * The `pipeline_table` is queried to find the highest existing run number for the current profile/app combination to determine the next number.
  * **User Input**: Users can type a full key to resume an existing workflow or manually create a new one (if the key doesn't exist, it will be created).
  * **Storage**: The active `pipeline_id` for the current session is stored in `db["pipeline_id"]`.

## 4. UI Interaction (Landing Page)

  * The landing page of a workflow (`self.landing()`) typically presents an input field for the `pipeline_id`.
  * This field is often a `type="search"` input associated with a `<datalist>` populated with existing keys for that workflow type, allowing users to easily find and select past runs.
    ```python
    # Simplified example from a landing() method
    existing_keys = [rec.pkey for rec in self.pipeline_table.xtra(app_name=self.APP_NAME)()]
    key_input = Input(
        type="search", name="pipeline_id",
        value=suggested_key, list="pipeline-ids-datalist",
        _onfocus='this.setSelectionRange(this.value.length, this.value.length)'
    )
    datalist = Datalist(*[Option(value=k) for k in existing_keys], id="pipeline-ids-datalist")
    # Form POSTs to /self.APP_NAME/init
    ```

## 5. Resuming Workflows

To resume a workflow:

1.  Enter or select its `pipeline_id` on the landing page.
2.  Submit the form.
3.  The `init` method loads the state associated with that `pipeline_id` from the `pipeline` table.
4.  The chain reaction (see `04_chain_reaction_pattern.mdc`) then automatically progresses the UI to the last completed or current input step.

## 6. Key Uniqueness & Scope

  * While the `{Profile}-{App}-{Num}` format is a strong convention, the system technically treats `pipeline_id` as a unique string primary key in the `pipeline` table.
  * Auto-numbering is scoped by `ProfileName` and `WorkflowAppName`.

## 7. Cleaning Up Workflows

  * **Specific Workflow**: Use the "üóëÔ∏è Delete Current Workflow" button (if implemented by the workflow, typically POSTs to `/delete-pipeline` with `pipeline_id`).
  * **All Workflows of a Type**: Use "üóëÔ∏è Delete All {WorkflowDisplayName} Workflows" (if implemented, POSTs to `/clear-pipeline`, which deletes all records for the current `APP_NAME` and profile).
  * These actions remove records from the `pipeline` table.

## 8. Relation to `APP_NAME`

The `APP_NAME` (internal workflow ID from the class) is crucial for:

  * Filtering existing keys for the datalist.
  * Scoping auto-incrementing run numbers.
  * Associating the stored JSON state with the correct workflow logic.

## 9. Common Implementation Mistakes

**LLMs frequently make these errors:**

1. **Missing HX-Refresh Response**: Forgetting to return the refresh response for empty keys
2. **Incorrect Key Generation**: Not using `pip.generate_pipeline_key(self)` properly
3. **Missing Cursor Positioning**: Forgetting the `_onfocus` attribute for user experience
4. **Wrong Route Handling**: Not understanding the difference between landing page and init routes
5. **State Inconsistency**: Not properly handling the key generation and storage flow
