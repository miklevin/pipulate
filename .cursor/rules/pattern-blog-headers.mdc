# Blog Post Header Pattern Guide

## Front Matter Structure
```yaml
---
title: "Main Title: With Optional Subtitle"
description: "A compelling description that expands on the title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: Author Name
group: blog
---
```

## Title Hierarchy
1. **Front Matter Title**: Used for SEO and navigation
2. **Content H1**: Should NOT repeat the front matter title
3. **Subsequent Headers**: Start at H2 and follow logical nesting

## Content Structure Rules
- No H1 tags in the content (they compete with the front matter title)
- Start content with an engaging opening paragraph
- Use H2 for main sections
- Use H3+ for subsections as needed
- Maintain proper header hierarchy (no skipping levels)

## Examples

### Good Structure
```markdown
---
title: "The Local-First Revolution: How Pipulate is Redefining Development"
description: "Discover how Pipulate's approach changes software development"
date: 2024-05-07
author: Mike Levin
group: blog
---

An engaging opening paragraph that introduces the topic...

## The Cloud Paradox

Content about the cloud paradox...

## The Pendulum Swings Back

More content...

```

### Bad Structure (Don't Do This)
```markdown
---
title: "The Local-First Revolution"
---

# The Local-First Revolution

## Introduction

Content...
```

## Best Practices
1. Front matter title should be descriptive and SEO-friendly
2. Description should expand on title without repeating it
3. Opening paragraph should hook the reader
4. Use consistent header capitalization
5. Keep header hierarchy logical and clear
6. Avoid duplicate titles/headers
7. Use proper Markdown formatting

## Common Patterns
- Use colons in titles to separate main concept from explanation
- Start with "The" for foundational articles
- Use "How to" for tutorials
- Use present progressive (-ing) for process articles
- Keep headers concise but descriptive
