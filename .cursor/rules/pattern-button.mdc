# Pipulate Workflow Button Conventions

## Navigation Button Conventions
When working with Pipulate Workflow plugins, use these consistent button styling conventions:

1. **Next Step Buttons**: Always use "Next â–¸" (with the small right-pointing triangle)
   ```python
   pip.wrap_with_inline_button(
       Input(...),
       button_label="Next â–¸"
   )
   ```

2. **Finalize Buttons**: Always use "Finalize ðŸ”’" (with the lock emoji)
   ```python
   Button("Finalize ðŸ”’", type="submit", cls="primary")
   ```

3. **Location Pattern**: These buttons appear in:
   - Form elements within step handlers (e.g., `step_01`, `step_02`)
   - The finalize handler's GET method

## Examples
Example implementation in [plugins/020_hello_workflow.py](mdc:pipulate/plugins/020_hello_workflow.py)

This visual convention mimics Jupyter Notebook's execution flow, with the triangle representing "run" and the lock representing "finalized/locked".

## Important Notes
- Keep changes minimally intrusive - only modify the button label text
- Don't change functionality or behavior of the buttons
- Maintain consistent styling across all workflow files
