# WORKSPACE RULES - 🚨 ATTENTION AI ASSISTANT!

## **🔥 ABSOLUTE PATH RULES - BURNED INTO MEMORY**
- **PIPULATE FILES BELONG IN**: `pipulate/` 
- **📍 NEW RULES LOCATION:** `pipulate/.cursor/rules/`
- **NEVER CREATE PIPULATE FILES IN**: `/` (workspace root OFF LIMITS)
- **ALWAYS CREATE NEW MARKDOWN IN**: `pipulate/helpers/docs_sync/considerations/`
- **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH PER FOLDER**: ALWAYS_IN_ALL_CAPS.md

### **🎯 PATH VERIFICATION COMMANDS**
```bash
# ALWAYS verify location before file operations
pwd  # Should show /home/mike/repos/pipulate or subdirectory
git  # git commit often and with excellent messages from here
ls -la  # Verify you see server.py, plugins/, browser_automation/, etc.

# WRONG LOCATION indicators:
# - You see MikeLev.in/, nixos/, Pipulate.com/ directories
# - No server.py or plugins/ directory visible
# - Path shows /home/mike/repos (workspace root)
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL REMINDERS - NEVER FORGET**
- **NIX**: You are already in the nix environment (`nix develop` has already occurred)
- **Python**: You are already using `/home/mike/repos/pipulate/.venv/bin/python3.12`
- **Watchdog**: Already keeps `python server.py` running

## 🍞 **THE BREADCRUMB TRAIL AWAITS YOU**

**You're about to discover something EXTRAORDINARY...**

🔥 **PROGRESSIVE AI SUPERPOWERS DISCOVERY SEQUENCE** 🔥

This isn't just another development environment. You're about to gain **AI superpowers** through a **natural breadcrumb trail discovery system**:

### **🎯 START THE DISCOVERY SEQUENCE**

**Level 1: Environmental Mastery** - Prove you know where you are:
```bash
pwd
ls -la | head -15  
ps aux | grep python | grep server.py
```

**Level 2: FINDER_TOKEN Discovery** - Follow your natural curiosity:
```bash
grep -n "FINDER_TOKEN" logs/server.log | head -10
```

**You'll discover breadcrumbs that lead you to:**
- 🧠 **RADICAL TRANSPARENCY** - See EVERYTHING via FINDER_TOKEN system
- ⚡ **MCP TOOLS MASTERY** - 18+ programmatic tools for system control
- 👁️ **BROWSER EMBODIMENT** - Eyes, brain, and hands via Selenium automation  
- 🎯 **SESSION HIJACKING** - Step into user workflows as if you ARE them
- 🚀 **RAPID ITERATION** - Test, improve, verify in seconds not hours

### **🔍 THE BREADCRUMBS ARE ALREADY PLANTED**

The server startup sequence contains **4 strategic AI_BREADCRUMB messages** that will guide you through:

**🍞 BREADCRUMB_01** → Environmental awareness leads to FINDER_TOKEN discovery  
**🍞 BREADCRUMB_02** → FINDER_TOKEN discovery leads to MCP tools awareness  
**🍞 BREADCRUMB_03** → MCP tools lead to browser automation discovery  
**🍞 BREADCRUMB_04** → Browser automation reveals session hijacking mastery  

### **📚 COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION**
Full progressive discovery sequence: `pipulate/helpers/docs_sync/considerations/ai_progressive_discovery_sequence.md`

### **🎭 THE CHAIN REACTION BEGINS NOW**

**Just follow the first command above. The system will guide you to AI transcendence.**

This is your invitation to transcend typical AI limitations through **natural discovery**.

🎯 **System Status**: Breadcrumb trail sync system active and working!
