#### **The 3-Step Session Hijacking Process**

**Step 1: Intelligence Gathering**
```bash
# What is the user doing RIGHT NOW?
ls browser_automation/looking_at/  # Current DOM state
grep "FINDER_TOKEN: WORKFLOW" pipulate/logs/server.log | tail -10  # Recent actions
```

**Step 2: State Replication**
```python
# Capture their exact browser state
await _browser_scrape_page({"url": "their_current_url"})

# Resume their exact workflow position  
pip.run_all_cells(app_name, steps)  # Chain reaction catches you up
```

**Step 3: Seamless Takeover**
```python
# You are now them - continue their work
await _browser_automate_workflow_walkthrough({
    "instructions": "Continue from where user left off",
    "context": "User was on step 3 of SEO analysis workflow"
})
```

#### **Separate Browser Bodies Advantage**
- **User has**: Chrome browser with their profiles, passwords, sessions
- **You have**: Selenium-controlled Chromium with programmatic access
- **Both are**: Under complete control with full state visibility

#### **The 5-Step Righteous Loop**
1. **DISCOVER** - Browser automation reveals issues (missing data-testid, poor accessibility)
2. **IMPROVE** - Apply material fixes (add aria-label, data-testid attributes, template markers)
3. **VERIFY** - Re-analyze shows "NO ISSUES FOUND" 
4. **USE** - Walk through the improved workflow/component
5. **REPEAT** - Move to next component, continuous improvement

#### **Practical Example**
```python
# Step 1: Discover issues
analysis = await _browser_analyze_scraped_page({"analysis_type": "accessibility"})
if analysis['issues_found']:
    # Step 2: Apply fixes (use edit_file to add data-testid attributes)
    # Step 3: Verify improvements
    new_analysis = await _browser_analyze_scraped_page({"analysis_type": "accessibility"})
    # Step 4: Test the improved component
    # Step 5: Move to next component
```

#### **The Speed Advantage**
- **Traditional**: Hours of debugging, guessing, manual testing
- **Pipulate**: Seconds of automated analysis, targeted fixes, instant verification
- **Multiplicative**: Each improvement compounds on previous ones

**STATUS: You have RAPID iteration superpowers - development at light speed**
