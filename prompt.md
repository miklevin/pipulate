Hello Gemini.

You are waking up on the `steeltrap` branch. Your last session successfully implemented the new CLI database inspector and cleaned up obsolete code. However, the server logs from the subsequent restart have revealed two final issues: a logical inconsistency in the backup count and a `TypeError` in the console output.

Your mission is to fix these two remaining issues, making the system's foundation fully transparent and robust.

**The Unbreakable Laws of Physics (Updated):**

1.  You are **always** in a Nix shell. You will **never** use `pip install`.
2.  You will **never** use `sed` for complex, multi-line edits. You will **always** use the `read_file` -\> modify -\> `write_file` pattern for file modifications.
3.  You will verify every change with `git diff`.
4.  You will commit after every single logical step.
5.  Your **Definition of Done** is when both steps are committed, the server restarts without errors, and the log file confirms the backup count is correct.
6.  Your **Completion Protocol** is to announce success with `echo "‚úÖ Steeltrap protocol complete. Foundation is transparent and robust."`

## **The Mission: Final Foundation Polish**

### **Step 1: Synchronize Backup Logic**

We will refactor the `backup_all_databases` function in `durable_backup_system.py` to use its own internal configuration, making it consistent with the summary table and fixing the incorrect log count.

**Action 1: Refactor `durable_backup_system.py`.**

```bash
sed -i 's/def backup_all_databases(self, main_db_path: str, keychain_db_path: str, discussion_db_path: str) -> Dict[str, bool]:/def backup_all_databases(self) -> Dict[str, bool]:/' imports/durable_backup_system.py && \
sed -i '/def backup_all_databases(self) -> Dict[str, bool]:/,/return results/c\
    def backup_all_databases(self) -> Dict[str, bool]:\
        """\
\n        üöÄ Perform complete backup of all critical databases.\
\n        \
\n        Called on server startup to ensure all data is protected.\
\n        """\
        results = {}\
        for key, config in self.critical_databases.items():\
            source_path = Path(config["source_path"])\
            if os.path.exists(source_path):\
                results[key] = self._backup_entire_database(str(source_path))\
            else:\
                logger.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Source database not found, skipping backup: {source_path}")\
                results[key] = False\
        \
        self.cleanup_old_backups(keep_days=7)\
        \
        successful = sum(1 for success in results.values() if success)\
        total = len(self.critical_databases)\
        if successful == total:\
             logger.info(f"üõ°Ô∏è Database backup complete: {successful}/{total} successful")\
        else:\
             logger.warning(f"üõ°Ô∏è FINDER_TOKEN: BACKUP_STARTUP_PARTIAL - {successful}/{total} databases backed up")\
        \
        return results' imports/durable_backup_system.py
```

**Action 2: Update the call site in `server.py`.**

```bash
sed -i "s/backup_results = backup_manager.backup_all_databases(main_db_path, keychain_db_path, discussion_db_path)/backup_results = backup_manager.backup_all_databases()/" server.py
```

**Verification:**

```bash
git diff
```

**Commit:**

```bash
git commit -am "refactor(backup): Synchronize backup execution with configuration

Refactors the `backup_all_databases` method in the durable backup system.
It no longer accepts hardcoded paths as arguments and instead iterates over its own `self.critical_databases` dictionary.

This fixes a logical inconsistency where the execution logic and the summary table logic could report different numbers of databases, leading to erroneous 'X/Y databases backed up' log messages. The system now robustly backs up all configured databases."
```

### **Step 2: Add Defensive Check for Rich Console Printing**

The `SAFE_CONSOLE` error originates in a file we cannot see (`ascii_displays.py`). To prevent this from ever causing silent issues, we will add a defensive check to `print_and_log_table` in `server.py` to ensure the `console` object is what we expect before using it with `rich`-specific features.

**Action:** Add a type check inside `print_and_log_table` in `server.py`.

```bash
sed -i "/def print_and_log_table(table, title_prefix=\"\"):/a \ \ \ \ from rich.console import Console\n\ \ \ \ if isinstance(console, Console):\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ console.print(table)\n\ \ \ \ else:\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ # Fallback for non-rich console environments\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ print(str(table))" server.py && \
sed -i "/console.print(table)/d" server.py
```

**Verification:**

```bash
git diff
```

**Commit:**

```bash
git commit -am "fix(logging): Add defensive type check for rich console printing

Adds a check in the `print_and_log_table` function to verify that the global `console` object is an instance of `rich.console.Console` before attempting to print a table with rich-specific features.

This prevents `TypeError` exceptions in environments where the console object might be unexpectedly shadowed or in non-rich contexts, addressing the 'SAFE_CONSOLE' error seen in logs."
```

-----

### **Step 3: Final Verification**

Restart the server and confirm our fixes worked.

**Action:**

```bash
touch server.py && sleep 8 && grep "Database backup complete" logs/server.log | tail -n 1
```

**Expected Output:** The `grep` command should now show a log message like `üõ°Ô∏è Database backup complete: 4/4 successful`, confirming the backup logic is correct. The server log should also be free of the `SAFE_CONSOLE` `TypeError`.

-----

Now, execute the `Completion Protocol`.
