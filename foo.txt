This codebase uses a hybrid approach with Nix for system dependencies and virtualenv for Python packages.
Key things to know:
- Always run `nix develop` before any commands in a new terminal
- FastHTML objects must be converted with to_xml() before returning responses
- The project is organized as a server with plugin-based workflows
