# Pipulate Installer v1.1.0
# =========================
# 
# This installer uses a "magic cookie" approach to setup a git-based nix flake without 
# requiring git to be available on the host system initially.
#
# === WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS ===
# We want effectively the same path whether it's macOS or Linux (which might include Windows WSL)
# because the value proposition of nix is deterministic behavior solving the "not on my machine" 
# problem. The nix flake provides a normalized version of Linux that runs things identically 
# across all host OSes. The exceptions are exactly that, tiny edge-case areas where we need 
# to insert special handling logic for radical differences in the host OS or hardware, such 
# as taking advantage of CUDA on non-Windows environments and the `--impure` flag needed on macOS.
# We go out of our way to re-unite the paths in all other locations so there is no special 
# host OS handling on core script functionality.
#
# === THE "MAGIC COOKIE" APPROACH ===
# Nix flakes require a git repository to function properly. However, requiring users to have 
# git pre-installed creates a dependency we want to avoid. So instead:
#
# 1. This assets/installer/install.sh script is distributed via curl (highly reliable across systems)
# 2. We download a zip of the repo (more reliable than git clone on diverse systems)
# 3. We extract the zip and place a ROT13-encoded SSH key in the .ssh folder
# 4. We run `nix develop` which activates the flake
# 5. The flake itself handles converting the directory into a proper git repo
#
# This is called a "magic cookie" approach because we provide the initial "cookie" 
# (SSH key + zip contents) that the nix flake later uses to transform itself into 
# a proper git repository with auto-update capabilities.
#
# === IMPORTANT ===
# DO NOT MOVE GIT FUNCTIONALITY INTO THIS SCRIPT. This approach deliberately avoids
# requiring git during the initial setup phase for maximum compatibility across systems.
# The more robust approach is to let nix ensure git is available before attempting any
# git operations in the controlled nix environment.

# (2) "SEO Software" is the RETIRED identity. The ancestor is named as lineage,

# gitUpdateLogic, so no magic-cookie transformation happens there. A verb naming
# an act no code performed, printed at first contact, on the one lane whose
# whole design goal is to be barely there. The default lane keeps its output

# The Terminal Hand-off:
# We spawn a fresh shell attached directly to the physical terminal. 
# This prevents the macOS SIGTTIN suspension caused by the curl pipe,
# and permanently eliminates the need for the user to type 'cd'.
# INSTALL-ONLY MODE (added 2026-08-01 for the MCK launcher). When a caller
# exports PIPULATE_INSTALL_ONLY=1, do the setup AND the environment hydration
# and then RETURN, instead of opening an interactive workshop the caller
# cannot resume from.
#
# GRACEFUL BY CONSTRUCTION: an older served copy of this script ignores an
# unknown environment variable and behaves exactly as it always has, so a
# launcher may set this unconditionally with no version detection.
#
# WHY .#quiet AND NOT THE DEFAULT SHELL: the default shellHook ends in
# `python server.py` in the foreground, so `nix develop --command` would start
# the server rather than return. .#quiet has no server, no JupyterLab and no
# boot menu -- but it also deliberately sets the venv up WITHOUT populating it
# (the uv lines live in runScript), so the install step is run explicitly here.
#
# NAMED LIMITATION, stated rather than discovered: .#quiet also skips the
# flake's gitUpdateLogic, so a workshop hydrated only through this path is not
# yet a git repository and does not auto-update. The magic-cookie
# transformation fires on the first plain `nix develop` in that folder. Riding
# a trail does not need it.
