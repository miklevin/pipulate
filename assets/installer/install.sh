# Pipulate Installer v1.1.0
# =========================
# 
# This installer uses a "magic cookie" approach to setup a git-based nix flake without 
# requiring git to be available on the host system initially.
#
# === WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS ===
# We want effectively the same path whether it's macOS or Linux (which might include Windows WSL)
# because the value proposition of nix is deterministic behavior solving the "not on my machine" 
# problem. The nix flake provides a normalized version of Linux that runs things identically 
# across all host OSes. The exceptions are exactly that, tiny edge-case areas where we need 
# to insert special handling logic for radical differences in the host OS or hardware, such 
# as taking advantage of CUDA on non-Windows environments and the `--impure` flag needed on macOS.
# We go out of our way to re-unite the paths in all other locations so there is no special 
# host OS handling on core script functionality.
#
# === THE "MAGIC COOKIE" APPROACH ===
# Nix flakes require a git repository to function properly. However, requiring users to have 
# git pre-installed creates a dependency we want to avoid. So instead:
#
# 1. This assets/installer/install.sh script is distributed via curl (highly reliable across systems)
# 2. We download a zip of the repo (more reliable than git clone on diverse systems)
# 3. We extract the zip and place a ROT13-encoded SSH key in the .ssh folder
# 4. We run `nix develop` which activates the flake
# 5. The flake itself handles converting the directory into a proper git repo
#
# This is called a "magic cookie" approach because we provide the initial "cookie" 
# (SSH key + zip contents) that the nix flake later uses to transform itself into 
# a proper git repository with auto-update capabilities.
#
# === IMPORTANT ===
# DO NOT MOVE GIT FUNCTIONALITY INTO THIS SCRIPT. This approach deliberately avoids
# requiring git during the initial setup phase for maximum compatibility across systems.
# The more robust approach is to let nix ensure git is available before attempting any
# git operations in the controlled nix environment.
