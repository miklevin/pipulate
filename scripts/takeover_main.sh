# Performs a "Time Lord Regeneration" for a Git branch.
# It renames the current experimental branch to a target branch (default: main),
# deletes the old remote experimental branch, and force-pushes the new
# target branch to become the new reality.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/regenerate.sh <experimental_branch_name>
# Example: ./scripts/regenerate.sh magicuser

# --- Configuration ---
# Exit immediately if a command fails
set -e
# The branch to become the new reality. Change this if you don't use 'main'.

# The name of your remote repository.
REMOTE="origin"

# --- Parameters & Sanity Checks ---
