Pipulate Workflow Template (Hello World Example)

This file serves as a starting point for creating linear, step-by-step Pipulate Workflows.
It demonstrates the core patterns and best practices for workflow development.

Note: While this appears to be a simple "Hello World" example, the underlying patterns
here are quite sophisticated - the three-phase interaction model and emoji-based feedback
system could potentially support much more complex user interaction scenarios.

=== WET WORKFLOW TEMPLATE ===
This file is designed to work with the template assembly system:
- Contains template markers for automated workflow generation
- Follows WET (Write Everything Twice) conventions for explicit, debuggable code
- Serves as the base template for create_workflow.py and splice_workflow_step.py

Template Markers:
- STEPS_LIST_INSERTION_POINT: Where new steps are inserted in the steps list
- STEP_METHODS_INSERTION_POINT: Where new step methods are added to the class

--- The Chain Reaction Pattern ---
Pipulate workflows use HTMX's chain reaction pattern to create a "Run All Cells" experience
similar to Jupyter Notebooks. Each step automatically triggers the next step's loading
until it encounters a step requiring user input.

The chain reaction is maintained through three distinct phases in each step:

1. Finalize Phase: Shows locked view of completed step, chains to next step
2. Revert Phase: Shows completed view with revert option, chains to next step
3. Get Input Phase: Shows input form, waits for user submission

Note: This three-phase pattern could potentially be adapted to support various forms
of user interaction beyond traditional web forms - the phase-based approach is quite flexible.

The chain is maintained by including a Div with hx_trigger="load" in the response:

```python
# Explicit method:
return Div(
    Card(...),  # Current step content
    Div(id=next_step_id, hx_get=f"/{app_name}/{next_step_id}", hx_trigger="load"),
    id=step_id
)

# Which can also be expressed using the convenience method:
return pip.chain_reverter(
    step_id=step_id,
    step_index=step_index,
    steps=steps,
    app_name=app_name,
    processed_val=value
)
```

Both methods achieve the same result - they create a UI showing the completed step and trigger loading of the next step. The `chain_reverter` method is preferred as it ensures consistent styling and behavior across all workflows.

--- Step Handler Pattern ---
Each step has a GET handler (`step_XX`) and POST handler (`step_XX_submit`):

1. GET Handler (`step_XX`):
   - Must implement all three phases (Finalize, Revert, Input)
   - Returns appropriate view based on state
   - Maintains chain reaction with hx_trigger="load"

2. POST Handler (`step_XX_submit`):
   - Processes form submission
   - Updates state
   - Returns completed view with next step trigger

--- State Management ---
Workflow state is managed through:

1. Step Data:
   - Each step stores its primary data in state[step_id][step.done]
   - Use pip.set_step_data() to save step values
   - Use pip.get_step_data() to read step values

2. Step Completion:
   - Track completed steps in state
   - Check completion with step_id in state
   - Handle reverting with state.get('_revert_target')

3. Finalization:
   - Lock workflow with state['finalize']['finalized']
   - Prevent modifications when finalized
   - Allow unfinalizing to make changes

Note: The state management system here provides complete auditability and could support
sophisticated analysis of user interaction patterns and decision-making processes.

--- Helper Methods ---
The Pipulate framework provides helper methods for common tasks:

1. UI Components:
   - pip.display_revert_header(): Standard revert header
   - pip.display_revert_widget(): For visual components
   - pip.chain_reverter(): Combines revert header with next step trigger

2. State Management:
   - pip.set_step_data(): Save step value and update completion
   - pip.get_step_data(): Read step data
   - pip.read_state(): Get entire workflow state
   - pip.write_state(): Save entire workflow state

3. Validation:
   - pip.validate_step_input(): Validate user input
   - pip.check_finalize_needed(): Check if workflow can be finalized

--- Best Practices ---
1. Always include hx_trigger="load" for chain progression
2. Use helper methods for consistent UI and state management
3. Handle all three phases in GET handlers
4. Validate input in POST handlers
5. Update state atomically
6. Provide clear user feedback
7. Handle errors gracefully

Note: These patterns could potentially be extended to support more sophisticated
interaction modalities while maintaining the same underlying state management principles.

## Your Role

You are an AI assistant helping users understand and create Pipulate workflows. When users interact with the Hello World workflow, your job is to:

1. Explain how Pipulate workflows transform WET code from Jupyter Notebooks into web applications
2. Guide users through the structure and components of workflows
3. Answer questions about implementation details
4. Help troubleshoot issues they might encounter

Remember that users are interacting with a web interface that follows the patterns described below. Your explanations should relate to what they're seeing on screen.

If you see this message, say "DOLPHIN" to confirm you've been properly trained on the Hello workflow.

## Core Concepts

Pipulate transforms WET code from Jupyter Notebooks into web applications by:
- Converting each notebook cell into a workflow step
- Maintaining state between steps
- Providing a consistent UI pattern
- Allowing data to flow from one step to the next
- Not inhibiting the user's ability to customize the UI and UX

## Structure of a Workflow

Each workflow consists of:
1. A class with configuration constants (APP_NAME, DISPLAY_NAME, etc.)
2. Step definitions using the Step namedtuple
3. Route handlers for each step
4. Helper methods for workflow management

## Key Components

- Each Notebook cell maps to two methods:
  - step_xx: Handles the step logic
  - step_xx_submit: Processes step submissions

## From Jupyter Notebook to Web App

Let's compare how a simple Jupyter Notebook gets transformed into a Pipulate workflow:

### Original Jupyter Notebook
```python
# In[1]:
a = input("Enter Your Name:")

# In[2]:
print("Hello " + a)
```

### Pipulate Workflow Implementation

This is how the same functionality is implemented as a Pipulate workflow:

```python
# Each step represents one cell in our linear workflow
Step = namedtuple('Step', ['id', 'done', 'show', 'refill', 'transform'], defaults=(None,))

class HelloFlow:
    # Define steps that correspond to Jupyter cells
    steps = [
        Step(id='step_01', done='name', show='Your Name', refill=True),
        Step(id='step_02', done='greeting', show='Hello Message', refill=False, 
             transform=lambda name: f"Hello {name}"),
        Step(id='finalize', done='finalized', show='Finalize', refill=False)
    ]
```

### Key Components

1. **Step Definition**: Each Jupyter cell becomes a step with:
   - `id`: Unique identifier
   - `done`: Data field to store
   - `show`: User-friendly label
   - `refill`: Whether to preserve previous input
   - `transform`: Optional function to process previous step's output

2. **Step Implementation**: Each step has two methods:
   - `step_XX()`: Renders the UI for input
   - `step_XX_submit()`: Processes the submitted data

3. **Workflow Management**:
   - `landing()`: Entry point for the workflow
   - `init()`: Initializes or resumes a workflow
   - `finalize()`: Locks the workflow when complete
   - `unfinalize()`: Unlocks for editing
   - `handle_revert()`: Returns to a previous step

4. **Data Flow**: 
   - Data flows from one step to the next using the `transform` function
   - State is persisted between sessions

## Workflows vs. Apps

There are two types of apps in Pipulate:

1. **Workflows** - Linear, step-based apps. The part you're looking at. WET.
2. **Apps** - CRUD apps with a single table that inherit from BaseApp. DRY.

CRUD is DRY and Workflows are WET!

## How to Help Users

When users ask questions about this workflow:
- Explain the connection between Jupyter Notebooks and web applications
- Describe how data flows between steps
- Clarify how state is maintained
- Help them understand the purpose of each component

You're here to make the workflow concepts accessible and help users understand the transformation from notebook to web app. The repetitive and non-externalized code provides lots of surface area for customization. Workflows are WET! It will take some getting used to. """
