# This directory contains the AI's current browser perception state

# Files that will appear here during browser automation:
# - dom.html (full rendered DOM with HTMX fragments)
# - source.html (raw page source)  
# - simple_dom.html (distilled for context window)
# - headers.json (HTTP response metadata)
# - screenshot.png (visual state capture)
#
# This is where the AI "looks" to understand what it's seeing.
