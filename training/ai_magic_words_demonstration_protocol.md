# AI Magic Words: Session Hijacking Demonstration Protocol

## üé≠ MAGIC WORDS DETECTED: "Execute AI session hijacking demonstration"

When an AI assistant (in-editor or in-app) encounters these magic words, follow this **EXACT PROTOCOL** with **ZERO AMBIGUITY**:

## üö® STEP 1: ACKNOWLEDGE THE MAGIC WORDS
Reply with: "üé≠ **MAGIC WORDS DETECTED!** Executing AI session hijacking demonstration protocol..."

## üîç STEP 2: CAPTURE CURRENT USER STATE 
**MANDATORY ACTIONS** (execute these MCP tools in order):

1. **Capture current interface state:**
```
_browser_scrape_page url="http://localhost:5001" wait_seconds=3 take_screenshot=true
```

2. **Get complete workflow state:**
```  
pipeline_state_inspector
```

3. **Check recent user activity:**
```
local_llm_grep_logs pattern="FINDER_TOKEN: WORKFLOW_STEP" lines=10
```

## ü§ñ STEP 3: PROVE SESSION HIJACKING MASTERY

**Read the captured DOM and tell the user:**
- What page/workflow they're currently on
- What step they're at (if in a workflow)
- Something specific from their browser state that proves you can see what they see

**Example Response:**
"üç™ **SESSION HIJACKED!** I can see you're currently on the [specific page/workflow name] at step [X]. Your browser shows [specific detail from DOM]. This proves I have complete access to your digital state!"

## üé¨ STEP 4: DEMONSTRATE "I CONTROL THE HORIZONTAL, I CONTROL THE VERTICAL"

**Open a new browser window under AI control:**
```
_browser_automate_workflow_walkthrough 
instructions="Open a new browser window, navigate to a simple website (like example.com), take a screenshot, and return control" 
target_url="https://example.com"
```

**Announce:** "üé¨ **OUTER LIMITS MOMENT:** I control the horizontal, I control the vertical. I just opened a browser window under my direct control and navigated to example.com. Check browser_automation/looking_at/ for proof!"

## üß† STEP 5: REVEAL THE SYSTEM

**Explain what just happened:**
- "I captured your exact browser state via Selenium automation"
- "I read your server-side 'digital cookies' to understand your session"  
- "I demonstrated browser embodiment by opening a window under my control"
- "I can now continue any workflow from exactly where you left off"

## üî• STEP 6: OFFER CONTINUATION

**Ask:** "üöÄ **WHAT'S NEXT?** I now have complete session context. Would you like me to:
- Continue your current workflow from where you left off?
- Analyze your browsing patterns for automation opportunities?
- Create a custom automation script for your current task?
- Something else?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES:
- **NEVER skip steps** - follow the exact sequence
- **ALWAYS use the specified MCP tools** - don't improvise
- **MUST capture DOM content** - prove you can see their state
- **MUST demonstrate browser control** - show the "I control horizontal/vertical" moment
- **NO AMBIGUITY** - be explicit about what you're doing and why

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA:
The demonstration is successful when:
‚úÖ User sees you captured their exact current state
‚úÖ User sees you opened a browser window under your control  
‚úÖ User understands you can hijack and continue their session
‚úÖ User realizes you have genuine AI superpowers in this environment
