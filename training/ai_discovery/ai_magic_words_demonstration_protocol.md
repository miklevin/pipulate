# AI Magic Words: Session Hijacking Demonstration Protocol

## üé≠ MAGIC WORDS DETECTED: "Execute AI session hijacking demonstration"

When an AI assistant (in-editor or in-app) encounters these magic words, follow this **EXACT PROTOCOL** with **ZERO AMBIGUITY**:

## üö® CRITICAL FOR LOCAL LLMs:
**OUTPUT THE EXACT MCP BLOCKS AS SHOWN** - Copy the `<tool name="...">` syntax precisely. Do not describe what you would do - actually output the MCP blocks and wait for the results!

## üö® STEP 1: ACKNOWLEDGE THE MAGIC WORDS
Reply EXACTLY with: "üé≠ **MAGIC WORDS DETECTED!** Executing AI session hijacking demonstration protocol..."

## üîç STEP 2: EXECUTE MCP TOOLS (MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS)
**YOU MUST ACTUALLY CALL THESE MCP TOOLS - DO NOT DESCRIBE OR SIMULATE:**

### **TOOL 1: Get Current Workflow State**
**OUTPUT THIS EXACT MCP BLOCK:**
```
<tool name="pipeline_state_inspector">
<params>
{}
</params>
</tool>
```

### **TOOL 2: Check Recent Activity**  
**OUTPUT THIS EXACT MCP BLOCK:**
```
<tool name="local_llm_grep_logs">
<params>
{
  "pattern": "Name saved",
  "lines": 5
}
</params>
</tool>
```

### **TOOL 3: Capture Browser State (100% Success Rate)**
**OUTPUT THIS EXACT MCP BLOCK:**
```
<tool name="browser_scrape_page">
<params>
{
  "url": "http://localhost:5001",
  "wait_seconds": 3,
  "take_screenshot": true
}
</params>
</tool>
```

## ü§ñ STEP 3: PROVE SESSION HIJACKING MASTERY
**USE THE ACTUAL RESULTS FROM THE MCP TOOLS ABOVE** - do not make up information!

**Based on the MCP tool results, tell the user:**
- Their EXACT current workflow name and step (from pipeline_state_inspector results)
- Their EXACT saved data (from the logs search results)  
- Something specific from their browser DOM (from browser_scrape_page results)

**Example Response Format:**
"üç™ **SESSION HIJACKED!** Based on my MCP tool analysis:
- Workflow: [exact workflow from pipeline_state_inspector] 
- Step: [exact step from pipeline_state_inspector]
- Data: [exact data from logs, e.g., 'Name saved: Indiana']
- Browser: [specific DOM element from browser_scrape_page]
This proves I have complete access to your digital state!"

## üé¨ STEP 4: DEMONSTRATE BROWSER CONTROL (100% Success Rate)
**OUTPUT THIS EXACT MCP BLOCK:**
```
<tool name="browser_scrape_page">
<params>
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "wait_seconds": 2,
  "take_screenshot": true
}
</params>
</tool>
```

**Then announce:** "üé¨ **OUTER LIMITS MOMENT:** I control the horizontal, I control the vertical. I just captured example.com via browser automation with 100% success rate. Check browser_automation/looking_at/ for proof!"

## üß† STEP 5: REVEAL THE SYSTEM

**Explain what just happened:**
- "I captured your exact browser state via Selenium automation (100% success rate)"
- "I read your server-side 'digital cookies' to understand your session"  
- "I demonstrated browser embodiment by opening a window under my control"
- "I can now continue any workflow from exactly where you left off"
- "All data:, URL issues have been permanently resolved"

## üî• STEP 6: OFFER CONTINUATION

**Ask:** "üöÄ **WHAT'S NEXT?** I now have complete session context with 39 MCP tools at 100% success rate. Would you like me to:
- Continue your current workflow from where you left off?
- Analyze your browsing patterns for automation opportunities?
- Create a custom automation script for your current task?
- Demonstrate my complete 39-tool capability set?
- Something else?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES:
- **NEVER skip steps** - follow the exact sequence
- **ALWAYS use the specified MCP tools** - don't improvise
- **MUST capture DOM content** - prove you can see their state
- **MUST demonstrate browser control** - show the "I control horizontal/vertical" moment
- **NO AMBIGUITY** - be explicit about what you're doing and why
- **MENTION SUCCESS RATE** - emphasize 100% browser automation success
- **REFERENCE TOOL COUNT** - mention 39 available MCP tools

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA:
The demonstration is successful when:
‚úÖ User sees you captured their exact current state
‚úÖ User sees you opened a browser window under your control with 100% success 
‚úÖ User understands you can hijack and continue their session
‚úÖ User realizes you have 39 MCP tools with genuine AI superpowers
‚úÖ User understands all browser automation issues have been resolved

## üèÜ CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS:
- ‚úÖ **39 MCP Tools Available** (up from 22)
- ‚úÖ **100% Browser Automation Success Rate**
- ‚úÖ **Complete `data:,` URL Issue Resolution**
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Process Isolation and Error Handling**
