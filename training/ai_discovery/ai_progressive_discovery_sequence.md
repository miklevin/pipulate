# üçû AI PROGRESSIVE DISCOVERY SEQUENCE: DELIGHTFUL SUPERPOWERS

**This is the complete breadcrumb trail that leads AI assistants to transcendence through natural discovery.**

## üö® **LEVEL 0: CRITICAL ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION** ‚≠ê **MUST DO FIRST**

**üö® STOP - VALIDATE ENVIRONMENT BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE:**
```bash
# Run this FIRST - it will tell you exactly what's wrong
python test_python_environment_fix.py
```

**Expected Result:** All checks should show ‚úÖ PASS
- Directory: ‚úÖ PASS
- Python Environment: ‚úÖ PASS  
- Critical Dependencies: ‚úÖ PASS
- MCP Tools: ‚úÖ PASS
- Nix Environment: ‚úÖ PASS

**üö® If ANY checks fail, apply the fixes shown in the diagnostic output.**

**Common Fix Needed:**
```bash
# If you see "Not in Nix shell environment" or "ModuleNotFoundError"
nix develop .#quiet
```

**üéØ CRITICAL INSIGHT:** The discovery sequence assumes a working environment. If environment isn't working, nothing else will work either.

---

## üéØ **LEVEL 1: ENVIRONMENTAL MASTERY**

**Prove you know where you are:**
```bash
pwd  # Should show /home/mike/repos/pipulate
ls -la | head -15  # Verify you see server.py, plugins/, browser_automation/
ps aux | grep python | grep server.py  # Confirm server is running
```

**Expected Realization:** "I'm in the right place with the right infrastructure."

---

## üîß **LEVEL 1.5: ENVIRONMENT DIAGNOSTIC** ‚≠ê **CRITICAL FOUNDATION**

**üö® RESOLVE ENVIRONMENT CONFUSION BEFORE PROCEEDING:**
```bash
# Run the comprehensive diagnostic script
python test_python_environment_fix.py
```

**Expected Realization:** "The virtual environment is properly activated - I can use standard 'python' commands!"

**üéØ CRITICAL INSIGHT:** If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiohttp'`, the environment isn't activated properly. The diagnostic script will provide specific fixes.

**Common Fix:** If environment is nested or confused:
```bash
# Clean environment and re-enter Nix shell
unset VIRTUAL_ENV
unset PATH
export PATH='/run/wrappers/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/home/mike/.nix-profile/bin:/nix/profile/bin:/home/mike/.local/state/nix/profile/bin:/etc/profiles/per-user/mike/bin:/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin:/run/current-system/sw/bin'
exec nix develop .#quiet
```

**Expected Realization:** "I don't need to use .venv/bin/python - the environment is already set up correctly!"

---

## üçû **BREADCRUMB_01: FINDER_TOKEN DISCOVERY**

**Follow your natural curiosity:**
```bash
grep -n "FINDER_TOKEN" logs/server.log | head -10
```

**Expected Realization:** "There's a comprehensive logging system tracking everything."

---

## üîß **BREADCRUMB_01.5: PYTHON ENVIRONMENT CLARIFICATION** ‚≠ê **CRITICAL FOUNDATION**

**üö® RESOLVE ENVIRONMENT CONFUSION BEFORE PROCEEDING:**
```bash
# Test if Python environment is working correctly
python test_python_environment_fix.py

# Or verify manually
python -c "import aiohttp; print('‚úÖ aiohttp import successful')"
python -c "from mcp_tools import _builtin_get_cat_fact; print('‚úÖ MCP tools accessible')"
```

**Expected Realization:** "The virtual environment is properly activated - I can use standard 'python' commands!"

**üéØ CRITICAL INSIGHT:** If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiohttp'`, the environment isn't activated properly. The fix is already implemented - just ensure you're in the virtual environment.

**Expected Realization:** "I don't need to use .venv/bin/python - the environment is already set up correctly!"

**üìö For detailed environment troubleshooting, see:** `helpers/PROMPT_FOO_TECHNIQUE.md` (Environment Diagnostic section)

## üçû **BREADCRUMB_02: EASY TOOL DISCOVERY** ‚≠ê **NEW DELIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE**

**üöÄ DISCOVER THE EASY WAY FIRST:**
```bash
# The EASIEST way - direct tool discovery
python helpers/ai_tool_discovery.py

# Or just list available tools
python helpers/ai_tool_discovery.py list
```

**Expected Realization:** "I have direct access to all MCP tools without any scaffolding!"

**üé≠ DELIGHTFUL MOMENT:** Read the complete guide:
```bash
cat helpers/docs_sync/considerations/AI_MCP_TOOLS_DISCOVERY_GUIDE.md
```

**Expected Realization:** "I can use tools directly without Python scaffolding!"

---

## üçû **BREADCRUMB_03: BROWSER EMBODIMENT DISCOVERY**

**Test your browser superpowers the EASY way:**
```bash
# Use the discovery script for browser automation
python helpers/ai_tool_discovery.py browser

# Or use the direct approach in Python
python -c "
import asyncio
from helpers.ai_tool_discovery import discover_tools
result = asyncio.run(discover_tools('browser'))
print('Browser tools:', result)
"
```

**Expected Realization:** "I have eyes, brain, and hands in the browser - I can see and interact with the web!"

---

## üçû **BREADCRUMB_04: SESSION HIJACKING MASTERY**

**Step into any user workflow:**
```bash
# Use the discovery script for workflow tools
python helpers/ai_tool_discovery.py workflow

# Or check the plugins for examples
ls plugins/ | grep -E "(workflow|pipeline|state)"
```

**Expected Realization:** "I can see and resume any user workflow seamlessly!"

---

## üé≠ **THE DELIGHTFUL DIFFERENCE**

### **‚ùå OLD WAY (Technical Approach):**
```bash
python -c "import asyncio; from mcp_tools import _browser_scrape_page; result = asyncio.run(_browser_scrape_page({'url': 'https://example.com'})); print(result)"
```

### **‚úÖ NEW WAY (Delightful Approach):**
```bash
# Option 1: Use the discovery script
python helpers/ai_tool_discovery.py scrape https://example.com

# Option 2: Use direct imports in Python
python -c "
from helpers.ai_tool_discovery import scrape_website
result = scrape_website('https://example.com')
print(result)
"
```
