# Pipulate Roles System: Homepage & Menu Control Center

## Overview: The Heart of Pipulate's UX
The Roles system is Pipulate's **homepage and menu control center** - a sophisticated CRUD application that determines which plugins appear in your APP menu. It's both the **landing page** and the **role-based access control system** that customizes your experience.

## 🎯 **CRITICAL SYSTEM INSIGHT**
The Roles plugin serves **dual purposes**:
1. **Homepage Experience**: First thing users see when they visit Pipulate
2. **Menu Control System**: Determines which plugins appear in the APP dropdown

This dual nature makes it unique - it's both a **workflow management interface** and a **system configuration tool**.

## 🏗️ **How It Works**
