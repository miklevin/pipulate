# Pipulate Roles System: Homepage & Menu Control Center

## Overview: The Heart of Pipulate's UX
The Roles system is Pipulate's **homepage and menu control center** - a sophisticated CRUD application that determines which plugins appear in your APP menu. It's both the **landing page** and the **role-based access control system** that customizes your experience.

## üéØ **CRITICAL SYSTEM INSIGHT**
The Roles plugin serves **dual purposes**:
1. **Homepage Experience**: First thing users see when they visit Pipulate
2. **Menu Control System**: Determines which plugins appear in the APP dropdown

This dual nature makes it unique - it's both a **workflow management interface** and a **system configuration tool**.

## üèóÔ∏è **How It Works**

### **Automatic Plugin Management**
- **Self-discovering**: New plugins automatically appear in the appropriate roles
- **Always up-to-date**: The system finds and categorizes plugins as they're added
- **Visual appeal**: Each plugin displays with its own unique emoji
- **No manual setup**: Everything works automatically without configuration

### **Built-in Role Types**
The system comes with six predefined roles, each serving different user needs:
- **Core**: Essential system plugins (always available)
- **Botify Employee**: Internal Botify tools and workflows
