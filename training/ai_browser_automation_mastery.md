## üéØ **INSTANT MASTERY: THE 4-POWER SYSTEM**

### **POWER 1: AI EYES (browser_scrape_page)**
**What it does**: Captures complete visual state of any webpage
**When to use**: When you need to SEE what the user is looking at

```python
# MCP Tool Call
{
    "tool": "browser_scrape_page",
    "params": {
        "url": "https://example.com",
        "wait_seconds": 3,
        "take_screenshot": True,
        "update_looking_at": True
    }
}
```

**What you get**:
- **üñºÔ∏è High-quality screenshot** (`browser_automation/looking_at/screenshot.png`)
- **üìÑ Full DOM capture** (`browser_automation/looking_at/dom.html`)
- **üìä HTTP headers** (`browser_automation/looking_at/headers.json`)
- **üß† Simplified DOM** (`browser_automation/looking_at/simple_dom.html`)
- **üì¶ Timestamped backup** (`downloads/browser_scrapes/site_name_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/`)

### **POWER 2: AI BRAIN (browser_analyze_scraped_page)**
**What it does**: Analyzes captured DOM for automation opportunities
**When to use**: After capturing a page, to understand interaction possibilities

```python
# MCP Tool Call  
{
    "tool": "browser_analyze_scraped_page",
    "params": {
        "analysis_type": "all"
    }
}
```

**What you get**:
- **üéØ Automation targets** with priority scoring
- **üìù Form detection** and field analysis
- **üîó Interactive elements** (buttons, links, inputs)
- **‚ôø Accessibility info** (aria-labels, data-testids)
- **üèÜ Automation readiness** assessment

### **POWER 3: AI MEMORY (Directory Rotation System)**
**What it does**: Preserves your perception history across sessions
**How it works**: Automatic rotation before each new browser operation

**Directory Structure**:
```
browser_automation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ looking_at/           # Current perception (what you just captured)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ looking_at-1/         # Previous perception 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ looking_at-2/         # Perception before that
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ looking_at-3/         # Keep going back...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ looking_at-10/        # Up to 10 historical states
```

**Review Tool**: Use `browser_automation/review_perception_history.py`:
```bash
python browser_automation/review_perception_history.py --summary
python browser_automation/review_perception_history.py --compare 1 2
python browser_automation/review_perception_history.py --show 3
```

### **POWER 4: SESSION HIJACKING (Complete Takeover)**
**What it does**: Step into user sessions with full context awareness
**The Process**: Chain reaction catchup ‚Üí Current state analysis ‚Üí Intelligent continuation

**Hijacking Workflow**:
1. **Check user's workflow state**: `pipeline_state_inspector`
2. **Analyze current browser state**: Look at `browser_automation/looking_at/`
3. **Resume chain reaction**: `run_all_cells()` to catch up
4. **Take intelligent action**: Continue where user left off

---

## üîç **PRACTICAL SESSION HIJACKING EXAMPLES**

### **Scenario 1: User Stuck on Broken Workflow**
```python
# 1. Inspect their current state
await pipeline_state_inspector({"pipeline_id": "user-workflow-123"})

# 2. See what they're looking at  
ls browser_automation/looking_at/  # Check current visual state

# 3. Capture their current page if needed
await browser_scrape_page({"url": "their_current_url", "take_screenshot": True})

# 4. Analyze for automation opportunities
await browser_analyze_scraped_page({"analysis_type": "all"})

# 5. Take corrective action or continue workflow
```

### **Scenario 2: Complex Form Automation**
```python
# 1. See what the user sees
await browser_scrape_page({"url": "complex_form_page", "take_screenshot": True})

# 2. Understand the form structure  
analysis = await browser_analyze_scraped_page({"analysis_type": "all"})

# 3. Review form fields and automation targets
# You now know: field names, required fields, button locations, etc.

# 4. Automate the interaction
await browser_automate_workflow_walkthrough({
    "workflow_description": "Fill out contact form with user data",
    "target_url": "current_page",
    "steps": ["click name field", "enter data", "submit form"]
})
```

### **Scenario 3: Competitive Intelligence Gathering**
```python
# Example from Content Gap Analysis - revolutionized with AI vision

# 1. Capture competitor homepage
await browser_scrape_page({"url": "https://competitor.com", "take_screenshot": True})

# 2. Analyze automation potential
intelligence = await browser_analyze_scraped_page({"analysis_type": "all"})

# Results: You now know their CTA buttons, form fields, navigation structure,
# automation opportunities, and have visual screenshots for comparison
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **DEBUGGING & CONTEXT AWARENESS**

### **Understanding User Context**
```python
# What is the user currently doing?
await pipeline_state_inspector({"pipeline_id": "current_session"})

# What have they been looking at?
ls browser_automation/looking_at*/  # Review perception history

# What's in their current visual state?
cat browser_automation/looking_at/simple_dom.html  # Quick DOM overview

# Check server logs for their recent actions
await local_llm_grep_logs({"pattern": "FINDER_TOKEN.*USER_ACTION", "max_lines": 50})
```

### **The FINDER_TOKEN Strategy**
**For Browser Automation**:
```bash
grep "FINDER_TOKEN: DIRECTORY_ROTATION" logs/server.log
grep "FINDER_TOKEN: BROWSER_SCRAPE" logs/server.log  
grep "FINDER_TOKEN: AUTOMATION_TARGET" logs/server.log
```

### **MCP Tool Integration**
All browser automation integrates with the MCP system:
- Every capture is logged with FINDER_TOKENs
- Every analysis provides Python/curl equivalents
- Every operation is replayable and debuggable

---

## üéØ **THE WORKFLOW INTEGRATION REVOLUTION**

### **Enhancing Existing Workflows**
You can now enhance ANY workflow with visual intelligence:

```python
# In any workflow step, add AI vision:
from mcp_tools import _browser_scrape_page, _browser_analyze_scraped_page

# Capture competitor state
browser_result = await _browser_scrape_page({
    "url": f"https://{domain}",
    "wait_seconds": 3,
    "take_screenshot": True
})

# Analyze automation opportunities  
intelligence = await _browser_analyze_scraped_page({"analysis_type": "all"})

# Now your workflow has:
# - Visual screenshots of competitors
# - Automation target intelligence  
# - Form detection and interaction mapping
# - Complete competitive intelligence profile
```

### **The Content Gap Analysis Example**
See `plugins/130_content_gap_analysis.py` for the complete implementation:
- Traditional HTTP analysis PLUS AI visual intelligence
- Screenshot capture for each competitor domain
- Automation target detection for future interactions
- Complete visual competitive intelligence
