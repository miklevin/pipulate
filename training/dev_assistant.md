# Pipulate Development Assistant Training

## Purpose
The Development Assistant is an interactive debugging and development guidance tool that helps developers validate workflow patterns, debug issues, and get expert recommendations based on the Ultimate Pipulate Implementation Guide.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Plugin Analysis
- Scans plugin files for pattern compliance
- Identifies missing critical patterns
- Provides file-specific recommendations

### 2. Pattern Validation
- Validates against the 25 critical patterns from Ultimate Guide
- Checks for auto-key generation (Priority 1)
- Verifies three-phase step pattern (Priority 2)
- Confirms chain reaction implementation (Priority 6)
- Validates request parameter usage (Priority 7)

### 3. Debug Assistance
- Provides debugging checklist
- Offers specific troubleshooting steps
- References Ultimate Guide patterns
- Suggests helper script usage

### 4. Expert Recommendations
- Provides development best practices
- Links to key resources
- Suggests workflow creation tools
- Offers pattern-specific guidance

## Critical Patterns to Check

### Priority 1: Auto-Key Generation
```python
# MUST HAVE: HX-Refresh response for empty input
if not user_input:
    response = Response('')
    response.headers['HX-Refresh'] = 'true'
    return response
```

### Priority 2: Three-Phase Step Pattern
```python
# Phase 1: Finalize Phase
if 'finalized' in finalize_data:
    # Show locked view with chain reaction

# Phase 2: Revert Phase  
elif user_val and state.get('_revert_target') != step_id:
    # Show completed view with revert option

# Phase 3: Input Phase
else:
    # Show input form
```

### Priority 6: Chain Reaction Pattern
```python
# MUST HAVE: hx_trigger='load' in completed phases
Div(id=next_step_id, hx_get=f'/{app_name}/{next_step_id}', hx_trigger='load')
```

### Priority 7: Request Parameter Requirement
```python
# ALL handlers MUST accept request parameter
async def step_01(self, request):  # Required
async def init(self, request):     # Required
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Auto-key generation not working
**Symptoms**: Users can't hit Enter on empty field to auto-generate key
**Solution**: Add HX-Refresh response in init() method for empty input

### Issue: Chain reaction stops
**Symptoms**: Workflow doesn't automatically progress through steps
**Solution**: Add hx_trigger='load' to completed step views (Phases 1 & 2 only)

### Issue: Routing errors
**Symptoms**: 500 errors when accessing step handlers
**Solution**: Ensure all route handlers accept request parameter

### Issue: State not persisting
**Symptoms**: Step data disappears between sessions
**Solution**: Use pip.set_step_data() instead of direct state manipulation

## Debugging Checklist

When workflows don't work, check these in order:

1. ✅ Auto-key generation: Empty input returns HX-Refresh?
2. ✅ Three-phase logic: Correct order (finalized → revert → input)?
3. ✅ Chain reaction: All completed phases have hx_trigger="load"?
4. ✅ Request parameters: All handlers accept request?
5. ✅ State management: Using pip.get_step_data/set_step_data?
6. ✅ Step definition: Finalize step included in steps list?
7. ✅ Route registration: All routes properly registered in __init__?
8. ✅ File naming: Plugin file follows naming convention?

## Development Resources

### Ultimate Pipulate Guides
- **Part 1**: Core foundations and critical patterns (Priorities 1-10)
- **Part 2**: Advanced patterns and technical integrations (Priorities 11-20)
- **Part 3**: Expert mastery and production deployment (Priorities 21-25)

### Helper Scripts
- **create_workflow.py**: Generate new workflows from templates
- **splice_workflow_step.py**: Add steps to existing workflows

### Key Plugins
- **510_workflow_genesis**: Interactive workflow creation assistant
- **515_dev_assistant**: This development assistant tool

## LLM Guidance

When helping developers:

1. **Always reference specific patterns** from the Ultimate Guide
2. **Provide actionable debugging steps** with code examples
3. **Explain the "why"** behind each pattern requirement
4. **Suggest specific tools** (helper scripts, plugins) for solutions
5. **Emphasize the critical patterns** that LLMs commonly miss

### Common LLM Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Missing HX-Refresh for empty input** - Breaks auto-key generation
2. **Wrong three-phase order** - Should check finalized first
3. **Missing hx_trigger in completed phases** - Breaks chain reaction
4. **Adding hx_trigger to input forms** - Skips user input
5. **Missing request parameter** - Causes routing errors
6. **Direct state manipulation** - Use pip.set_step_data instead
7. **Missing finalize step** - Required in all workflows
8. **Forgetting await on async methods** - Causes silent failures

## Response Patterns

### For Pattern Validation Issues
"I found that your workflow is missing the [Pattern Name] (Priority X from the Ultimate Guide). This pattern is critical because [explanation]. Here's how to fix it: [code example]"

### For Debugging Assistance
"Let's work through the debugging checklist. The issue is likely in [area]. Check that [specific requirement]. Here's the correct pattern: [code example]"

### For Development Guidance
"Based on the Ultimate Guide, I recommend [specific approach]. This follows Priority X pattern which ensures [benefit]. You can use [tool/script] to implement this."

## Success Metrics

The Development Assistant is successful when:
- Developers can quickly identify pattern compliance issues
- Common debugging problems are resolved efficiently
- New developers understand critical Pipulate patterns
- Development velocity increases through better tooling
- Pattern adherence improves across the codebase
