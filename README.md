- **Local-First Sovereignty:** Your data, code, and AI run on your hardware by default—extending to cloud services when you choose. This guarantees privacy, eliminates surprise costs, and gives you complete control over when and how to scale.
- **WET Workflows, DRY Framework:** Workflows are intentionally "WET" (explicit & step-by-step) for maximum clarity and customizability—perfectly mirroring Jupyter Notebooks. The underlying framework is "DRY" for efficiency.

- **The AI Advantage:** AI makes WET practical. Tedious code maintenance and refactoring, once a weakness of WET, is now an area where AI excels, turning repetition into a strength for rapid, context-aware development. Our breakthrough **Workflow Reconstruction System** exemplifies this: intelligent AST-based transplantation of workflow components eliminates traditional OOP inheritance complexity while maintaining perfect code precision.
- **Radical Transparency ("Know EVERYTHING!"):** We reject opaque enterprise patterns in favor of complete observability. State is managed in transparent SQLite tables and JSON blobs, making the entire system intuitive and debuggable. No black boxes, ever.
- **Reproducibility with Nix:** Nix Flakes provide a perfect, reproducible Linux environment on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL), solving the "works on my machine" problem.
- **Future-Proof Stack:** We rely on durable standards: Python, SQLite, HTML, and HTMX. This is a framework built to last.

### Primary Goals

1. **Empower End-Users (e.g., SEO Practitioners):** Enable non-programmers to run powerful, AI-guided workflows (often ported from Jupyter Notebooks) without needing to interact with Python code directly.
2. **Serve Developers:** Provide a simple, reproducible environment for building these workflows, leveraging integrated tooling like Jupyter, local LLMs, and a streamlined web framework.

## Philosophy: A Blueprint for Human-AI Cognitive Partnership

### Introduction: Software as a Cognitive Artifact

Pipulate is more than a framework; it is an exploration into the nature of human-AI collaboration. It is built on the belief that software should not be a rigid tool that imposes its logic upon us, but a fluid medium that mirrors and extends the way we think. This document outlines the core principles that guide its architecture and development.

### 1. The Principle of Cognitive Ergonomics

Human working memory is finite. We believe software should respect these natural cognitive boundaries rather than fight against them.

* **The Rule of 7**: Code and file structures are intentionally kept small and focused. As seen in the `plugins/` directory, workflows are granular, allowing a developer to hold the entire context of a single component in their mind at once.
* **The Chain Reaction Pattern**: Workflows progress in a linear, predictable sequence (`run_all_cells()`). This mirrors the step-by-step process of human learning, where each insight builds upon the last to create a coherent stream of understanding.

### 2. The Principle of Radical Transparency

For a human and an AI to collaborate effectively, they must share the same reality. The system must be completely observable to all participants.

* **Everything is Logged**: Functions like `log_api_call_details` and `log_dictlike_db_to_lifecycle` create a rich, narrative log that serves as the collective memory of the system.
* **WET (Write Everything Twice) is a Strength**: With AI as a partner, the traditional drawback of repetitive code disappears. Explicit, non-abstracted code is easier for an AI to understand, analyze, and refactor, turning a perceived weakness into a strength.

### 3. The Principle of the Unified Cognitive Space

The separation of "frontend" and "backend" is an artificial construct that creates cognitive friction. Pipulate rejects this.

* **Python as the Templating Language**: By using **FastHTML**, Python functions directly generate UI components. This eliminates the need for context-switching between different languages and mental models, creating a seamless flow from logic to interface.
* **HTMX for Fluid Interaction**: State is managed on the server. The browser is treated as a thin client that renders HTML fragments, ensuring a single source of truth and dramatically simplifying the cognitive load.

### 4. The Principle of Cognitive Sovereignty

Your thoughts, your data, and your creative processes belong to you. Our architecture is a moral stance on privacy and ownership.

* **Local-First by Default**: The entire system, including the AI models via Ollama, runs on your machine. Your data never leaves your control unless you explicitly choose to send it to an external API.
* **Durable and Independent**: By building on timeless technologies like Python, SQLite, and Nix, Pipulate frees you from the exhausting cycle of framework churn and vendor lock-in.

### 5. The Principle of the Living Ecosystem

Pipulate is not a static application; it is a dynamic environment for collaborative evolution.

* **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools**: AI assistants are not just invoked; they are active participants. The `mcp_tools.py` framework defines a clear API for AI capabilities, allowing them to inspect state, interact with the system, and contribute to the workflow.
* **A Taxonomy of Thought**: The `plugins/` architecture creates a living library of reusable problem-solving patterns. Each plugin is a crystallized cognitive strategy, ready to be deployed, adapted, and combined.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Technical Stack: Simple Yet Powerful

Pipulate's WET philosophy extends to its technology choices, favoring simple, durable tools over complex abstractions:

## *Not On My Machine* Problem Fixed  <!-- key: not-on-my-machine-problem-fixed -->

> The Cloud's popularity has been driven in part by developers not wanting to maintain multiple codebases or installers per OS. Thanks to Nix, that's all fixed.

* **Nix Flakes:** Manages dependencies and creates reproducible environments, ensuring consistency across developers and operating systems, with optional CUDA support. E.g. Is this a Linux-thing you're reading about here? A Windows thing? A Mac thing? The answer is: YES!!! All of the above — and if you've got cool acceleration hardware, it will even take advantage and utilize that too. Best of all worlds.

```
     ____                      _       _                        .--.      ___________
    |  _ \  __ _ _ ____      _(_)_ __ (_)_  __    ,--./,-.     |o_o |    |     |     |
    | | | |/ _` | '__\ \ /\ / / | '_ \| \ \/ /   / #      \    |:_/ |    |     |     |
    | |_| | (_| | |   \ V  V /| | | | | |>  <   |          |  //   \ \   |_____|_____|
    |____/ \__,_|_|    \_/\_/ |_|_| |_|_/_/\_\   \        /  (|     | )  |     |     |
                                                  `._,._,'  /'\_   _/`\  |     |     |
    Solving the "Not on my machine" problem well.           \___)=(___/  |_____|_____|
```

**Nix serves as the "Noah's Ark"** — preserving this perfect focus in a reproducible environment that works identically across all platforms. Once you've locked in the focus, it lasts for years or decades, all bottled up in infrastructure-as-code.

## Other Key Technologies Used

Pipulate integrates a carefully selected set of tools aligned with its philosophy:

* **FastHTML:** A Python web framework prioritizing simplicity. It generates HTML directly from Python objects (no template language like Jinja2) and minimizes JavaScript by design, working closely with HTMX. It's distinct from API-focused frameworks like FastAPI. The Python function-naming *is the HTML-template language.*

- **A**SGI: Modern async server interface, future-proofed for performance
- **M**iniDataAPI: Universal SQL simplifier close to Python's core data structures
- **P**ython + FastHTML + HTMX: The new web development paradigm

This isn't just simpler — it's more powerful, giving you complete environment reproducibility, local AI integration, server-side state management, and future-proofed skills.

### The Lens Stack: Focused Architecture  <!-- key: the-lens-stack -->

Pipulate's technology choices form **aligned lenses** that focus ideas from abstraction to actualization. Each lens must be **ground and polished** without misaligning the focus:

```
     Universal Translator of       Abstractions clarify into implementations
     Spoken Language to Code       by each lens being simple and transparent.

  Idea --> Lens 1   -->   Lens 2  -->  Lens 3  -> Lens 4 -> Lens 5 -> Lens 6

     -----> `--'           AI Help
          AI Help
```

We keep lenses minimal, their material either thoroughly pre-trained into the model (Python 3.x, HTMX, etc.) or able to be included in the prompt and easily held in the context window. We've trimmed the cruft — the lens flashes and burrs, and all unnecessary extra lenses (Angular, React, Vue, etc.)

```yaml
HARDWARE:
  install.sh: Published on Pipulate.com to initiate magic cookie install 
  flake.nix: Nix IaC creating a normalized Linux subsystem on any host OS
PROTOCOL:
  http: Uvicorn fast Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) web server
  html: Uvicorn talks to Python Starlette using anyio & httpx libraries
LINGUA:
  htmx: /assets/htmx.js JavaScript library to eliminate most need for JavaScript
  Python: .venv/bin/python3.12 latest version AIs are well trained on
UI/UX:
  browser: Obviously, but I guess it needs to be said. Like a looser Electron.
  fasthtml: /assets/fasthtml.js for FT Components, Python functions as templating
APP:
  app: Flask-style Uvicorn factory instance instantiated by FastHTML fast_app
  db: Dict-like DB providing transparent server-side state (server cookies)
  pipulate: Pipeline state management, like db but with JSON blob for workflows
```

### Grinding Off the Burrs and Flashes  <!-- key: grinding-off-burrs-flashes -->

In lens manufacturing, "flashes" are excess material that squeeze out of molds — unwanted projections that must be ground off. Steve Jobs famously did this twice: adopting Gorilla Glass (grinding off plastic flashes) and rejecting Flash Player (grinding off software bloat).

**Pipulate continues this tradition:**
- **FastHTML**: Grinds off Jinja2 template complexity
- **HTMX**: Grinds off virtual DOM overhead
- **Local AI**: Enables privacy by default, cloud power when desired
- **SQLite**: Grinds off enterprise database complexity

The result: clean, focused tools that do their job without unnecessary cruft.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## From Flask to FastAPI to FastHTML

This is not your father's Python web framework. HTMX changes everything — a marriage made in heaven between Python and the Web, finally turning Python into a first-class citizen for web development. In many use cases such as this one, Python is even preferable to JavaScript in the way it blends Python's formidable ecosystem of packages with workflows.

### The Evolution: Flask → FastAPI → FastHTML  <!-- key: the-evolution-flask-fastapi-fasthtml -->

The revolution isn't just another framework — it's eliminating the template layer entirely:

```

**The FastHTML Breakthrough:** Python function names directly become HTML elements, eliminating templates and making the server the single source of truth for UI state.

* **HTMX:** Enables dynamic, interactive UIs directly in HTML via attributes, minimizing the need for custom JavaScript. Pipulate uses it for server-rendered HTML updates — *over the wire HTML*-fragments targeting elements of the DOM directly instead of fragile, performance-reducing, framework-dependent JSON. *THIS* is where you *jump off the tech-churn hamsterwheel* and future-proof yourself.

* **MiniDataAPI:** A lightweight layer for interacting with SQLite and other databases. Uses Python dictionaries for schema definition, promoting type safety without the complexity of traditional ORMs — effectively future-proofing your SQL. You lose fancy *join* capabilities but in exchange get the *Python dict interface* as your main persistent database API forever-forward, enabiling instant swapability between SQLite and PostgreSQL (for example).

* **Ollama:** Facilitates running LLMs locally, enabling in-app chat, workflow guidance, and future automation capabilities while ensuring privacy and avoiding API costs. Your local AI (Chip O'Theseus) learns & grows with you, hopping from hardware to hardware as you upgrade — like a genie in a hermitcrab shell. And if that weren't kooky enough — it knows how to make MCP-calls!!! That's right, your friendly localhost AI Chip O'Theseus is also an *MCP client!* Your linear workflows ain't so linear anymore when a single-step can be: "Go out and do whatever."

### The Hybrid Advantage: Best of Both Worlds

**Pipulate isn't anti-cloud—it's pro-choice.** Each workflow step can choose the best tool for the job:

- **Step 1**: Use local AI for sensitive data analysis (privacy-first)
- **Step 2**: Call OpenAI's API for advanced reasoning (cloud power)  
- **Step 3**: Process results locally and save to SQLite (data sovereignty)
- **Step 4**: Use Anthropic's API for final review (frontier capabilities)

**This is the Swiss Army knife approach:** Local by default, cloud by choice, with complete visibility into what's happening at each step. Whether you're processing confidential client data (local) or need cutting-edge AI capabilities (cloud), Pipulate gives you the framework to do both seamlessly.

* **SQLite & Jupyter Notebooks:** Foundational tools for data persistence and the workflow development process (porting from notebooks to Pipulate workflows). SQLite is built into Python and really all things — the *get-out-of-tech-liability free card* you didn't know you had. And a full JupyterLab instance is installed side-by-side with Pipulate sharing the same Python `.venv` virtual environment, which is also shared with your preferred AI code editor (Cursor, Windsurf, VSCode, Zed) so... well... uhm, there are no words for when 3 different portals-to-Python share the same environment. You can do such stupid AI-tricks as letting your local LLM and a frontier cloud model *inhabit* the same body (Pipulate) — controlling web browsers together and stuff.

    Simple as 1-2-3! No Docker, no build steps, works with or without cloud services.
Everything runs locally with complete flexibility and control.
```

**Step 1: Install Nix (One-Time Setup)**

If you don't have it already, install the Nix package manager. It's the system that makes Pipulate's reproducible environment possible.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

> **Important:** After the Nix installation finishes, you **must close and reopen** your Terminal window.

**Step 2: Run the Pipulate Installer**

Now, run the universal install script. You can give your project a custom name, too.

```bash
# To install with a custom name like "Botifython"
curl -L https://pipulate.com/install.sh | bash -s Botifython

# Or, to install with the default name "pipulate"
curl -L https://pipulate.com/install.sh | bash
```

**Step 3: Launch Pipulate**

Navigate into your new project directory and launch the environment with `nix develop`.

```bash
# cd into the directory you just created
cd ~/Botifython

# Launch Pipulate
nix develop
```

That's it! The server and JupyterLab will start, and the application will open in your browser.

**Running It Again:**

1. You can just forcibly exit out of that Terminal it's running from.
2. Open a new Terminal, and once again:

```bash
cd ~/Botifython
nix develop
```

**The Big Reset (If Necessary):**

Things sometimes go wrong. This is how you do a full Pipulate reset. This will also delete anything you downloaded with Pipulate. Adjust custom install name to what you used.

```bash
rm -rf ~/Botifython
curl -L https://pipulate.com/install.sh | bash -s Botifython
cd ~/Botifython
nix develop
```

Wait for ***BOTH TABS*** to auto-open in your browser.

### 🚨 Installation Troubleshooting

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `nix: command not found` | You didn't restart your terminal after Nix installation |
| Browser doesn't open automatically | Manually visit `http://localhost:5001` and `http://localhost:8888` |
| `Permission denied` errors | Make sure you can write to `~/pipulate` directory |
| Port conflicts | Kill processes on ports 5001/8888: `lsof -ti:5001 \| xargs kill -9` |
| Nix build fails | Clear Nix cache: `nix-collect-garbage` then retry |

**System Requirements:**
- **macOS**: 10.15+ (Intel/Apple Silicon)
- **Linux**: Any modern distribution with curl 
- **Windows**: WSL2 with Ubuntu 20.04+
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Disk**: 2GB for installation + data storage
- **Network**: Internet connection for initial setup only

---

### PATH 2: Alternative Installation via PyPI (For Python Developers)  <!-- key: alternative-installation-pypi -->

If you are a developer comfortable with tools like Homebrew and `pipx`, you can use our PyPI package as a gateway to the same robust installation.

**Step 1: Install `pipx`**

`pipx` is a tool for safely installing Python command-line applications. If you don't have it, you can install it with Homebrew.

```bash
brew install pipx
```

**Step 2: Install the Pipulate CLI**

Use `pipx` to install the `pipulate` command-line tool. This will not cause conflicts with your system Python.

```bash
pipx install pipulate
```

**Step 3: Run the Installer**

Use the command you just installed to set up the full Pipulate application.

```bash
pipulate install
```

This will trigger the same universal installation process, resulting in the exact same robust, Nix-managed environment. To run it in the future, just type `pipulate run`.

These few commands:
- ✅ Updates to the latest version automatically
- ✅ Starts JupyterLab and the Pipulate server
- ✅ Opens web interfaces in your browser
- ✅ Provides a complete, reproducible development environment

**That's it!** You now have a local-first development environment with AI integration, installed via your preferred Python toolchain.

## The WET Revolution: Why Explicit Code Wins in the AI Era

Pipulate is built on a radical philosophy that challenges programming orthodoxy: **WET (Write Everything Twice) is better than DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** when you have AI to help manage it.

### The Universal API Pattern: From Quarks to Code  <!-- key: universal-api-pattern -->

At every scale of reality, we see the same pattern: **"lumps of stuff" with APIs** that enable interaction. Quarks combine into atoms, atoms into molecules, cells into organisms, individuals into societies. Each level requires the right **granularity** of interface — not so abstract that you lose control, not so granular that you drown in complexity.

**This is the 80/20 rule of existence:** Handle 80% of interactions gracefully with 20% of the API surface, then handle edge cases as needed. Pipulate applies this principle to code architecture.

### Durable vs. Ephemeral: Building on Bedrock  <!-- key: durable-vs-ephemeral -->

The tech industry suffers from "hamster wheel syndrome" — constantly breaking APIs that force migration cycles. React (20+ versions), Node (frequent breaking changes), Angular (complete rewrites). This isn't progress; it's planned obsolescence.

**Pipulate chooses durable foundations:**
- **Linux Kernel**: Version 6 in 30 years
- **Python**: Version 3 in 30 years
- **HTML**: Version 5 and stable
- **HTTP**: Version 3 and backward compatible

These are the "laws of physics" for software — stable APIs that enable compound growth rather than constant rebuilding.

### Why WET Works Now  <!-- key: why-wet-works-now -->

Traditional development follows DRY principles, creating abstract, complex systems that are hard to understand and modify. But the world has changed:

1. **🔬 Jupyter Notebooks** promote explicit, literate programming
2. **🤖 AI assistants** excel at managing repetitive code
3. **🏠 Local-first architectures** prioritize clarity over enterprise complexity
4. **🎯 Right Granularity**: WET provides the perfect abstraction level for human AND AI comprehension

## Developer Setup & Environment Notes

**Nix Environment Activation:** Always run `nix develop` from the `~/pipulate` directory *before* running any project commands (`python server.py`, `pip install`, etc.) in a new terminal. This ensures you are using the correct dependencies defined in `flake.nix`.

**Interactive vs. Quiet Shell:**

**Standard Shell:** `nix develop` (or `nix develop .#default`) runs the startup script (`run-script` defined in `flake.nix`) with welcome messages and service startup. Ideal for general use.

**Quiet Shell:** `nix develop .#quiet` activates the Nix environment *without* running the full startup script or launching services automatically. It only sets up paths and installs pip requirements. Use this for:
- Running specific commands without starting the servers (e.g., `nix develop .#quiet --command python -c "import pandas"`).
- Debugging or interacting with AI assistants where verbose startup output is undesirable.
- Manually running `run-server` or `run-jupyter` (scripts placed in `.venv/bin` by the `shellHook`).

**Dependencies:** System-level dependencies (Python version, libraries like `gcc`, `zlib`) are managed by `flake.nix`. Python package dependencies are managed by `pip` using `helpers/setup/requirements.txt` within the Nix-provided environment.

**Source of Truth:** The `flake.nix` file is the definitive source for the development environment setup.

## Architecture & Key Concepts

Pipulate features a distinct architecture designed for its local-first, simple, and observable nature.

### Architecture Overview Diagram  <!-- key: architecture-overview-diagram -->

This diagram illustrates the high-level components and their interactions:

```
                 ┌─────────────┐ Like Electron, but full Linux subsystem
                 │   Browser   │ in a folder for macOS and Windows (WSL)
                 └─────┬───────┘
                       │ HTTP/WS
                       ▼
    ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
    │           Nix Flake Shell             │ - In-app LLM (where it belongs)
    │  ┌───────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  │ - 100% reproducible
    │  │   FastHTML    │  │    Ollama    │  │ - 100% local
    │  │   HTMX App    │  │  Local LLM   │  │ - 100% multi-OS
    │  └───────┬───────┘  └──────────────┘  │
    │          │                            │

    │    └───────────┘     └────────────┘   │
    └───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This complete, self-contained environment runs identically on any operating system, providing the foundation for all Pipulate workflows and AI interactions.

---

### Integrated Data Science Environment  <!-- key: integrated-data-science-environment -->

Jupyter Notebooks run alongside the FastHTML server, allowing developers to prototype workflows in a familiar environment before porting them to Pipulate's step-based interface for end-users. The same Python virtual environment (`.venv`) is shared, and ad-hoc package installation is supported. If you're using Cursor, VSCode or Windsurf, set your `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` "Python: Set Interpreter" to "Enter Interpreter Path" `./pipulate/.venv/bin/python`. You might have to adjust based on the folder you use as your workspace. But then you'll have a Python environment unified between Cursor, JupyterLab and Pipulate.

```
      ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐
      │   Jupyter Lab    │    │    FastHTML      │
      │   Notebooks      │    │     Server       │
      │ ┌──────────┐     │    │  ┌──────────┐    │
      │ │ Cell 1   │     │    │  │ Step 1   │    │
      │ │          │     │--->│  │          │    │
      │ └──────────┘     │    │  └──────────┘    │
      │ ┌──────────┐     │    │  ┌──────────┐    │
      │ │ Cell 2   │     │    │  │ Step 2   │    │
      │ │          │     │--->│  │          │    │
      │ └──────────┘     │    │  └──────────┘    │
      │  localhost:8888  │    │  localhost:5001  │
      └──────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘
```

### Local-First & Single-Tenant Details  <!-- key: local-first-single-tenant-details -->

Pipulate manages all state server-side within the local environment (think *local-server cookies*), with optional cloud integration as needed. This approach offers:
* **Privacy & Control:** Data stays local by default, cloud integration when you choose.
* **Full Resource Access:** Utilize local CPU/GPU freely for intensive tasks, plus cloud APIs for heavy lifting.
* **Simplicity:** Eliminates complexities of multi-tenancy while supporting both local and cloud workflows.
* **Observability:** State changes (via DictLikeDB/JSON) are transparent and easily logged (AI greps it there).

### Local-First State Management Benefits  <!-- key: local-first-state-management-benefits -->

This detailed view shows how Pipulate's local-first architecture eliminates common web development complexities:

```
      ┌───────────────────────────────┐ # Benefits of Local-First Simplicity
      │          Web Browser          │
      │                               │ - No mysterious client-side state
      │    ┌────────────────────┐     │ - No full-stack framework churn
      │    │   Server Console   │     │ - No complex ORM or SQL layers
      │    │     & Web Logs     │     │ - No external message queues
      │    └─────────┬──────────┘     │ - No build step required
      │              ▼                │ - Direct, observable state changes
      │    ┌─────────────────────┐    │
      │    │  Server-Side State  │    │ - Conceptually like local-server-side cookies
      │    │  DictLikeDB + JSON ◄──────── Enables the "Know EVERYTHING!" philosophy
      │    └─────────────────────┘    │ - AI greps logs/server.log to see app state!
      └───────────────────────────────┘
```

### Server-Rendered UI (HTMX)  <!-- key: server-rendered-ui-htmx -->

The UI is constructed primarily with server-rendered HTML fragments delivered via HTMX. This minimizes client-side JavaScript complexity.
* FastHTML generates HTML components directly from Python.
* HTMX handles partial page updates based on user interactions, requesting new HTML snippets from the server.
* WebSockets and Server-Sent Events (SSE) provide real-time updates (e.g., for chat, live development reloading).

```
                        HTMX+Python enables a world-class
                  Python front-end Web Development environment.
                             ┌─────────────────────┐
                             │    Navigation Bar   │  - No template language (like Jinja2)
                             ├─────────┬───────────┤  - HTML elements are Python functions
  Simple Python back-end     │  Main   │   Chat    │  - Minimal custom JavaScript / CSS
  HTMX "paints" HTML into    │  Area   │ Interface │  - No React/Vue/Angular overhead
  the DOM on demand ───────► │         │           │  - No "build" process like Svelte
                             └─────────┴───────────┘  - No virtual DOM, JSX, Redux, etc.
```

With such *minimal surface area* the AI code assistant *knows everything.* LLMs are either pre-trained on the stable, infrequently revved libraries used (Python 3.12, HTMX, or it's all small enough to fit in a 1-shot prompt — yes, the whole core code-base fits in one Gemini Web UI form submit.

## Workflow Patterns & Development

### Pipeline Workflows  <!-- key: pipeline-workflows -->

Designed for porting notebook-style processes, workflows are sequences of steps where the state is managed explicitly at each stage and stored persistently (typically as a JSON blob in the `pipeline` table).
* **Resumable & Interrupt-Safe:** Because each step's completion is recorded, workflows can be stopped and resumed.
* **Explicit State Flow:** Data typically passes from one step's output (`done` field) to the next via the `transform` function, simplifying debugging. Patterned on Unix pipes.
* **Good Training Data:** The structured input/output of each step creates valuable data for potentially fine-tuning models.
* **Proprietary Friendly:** Excellent for proprietary domain-experts and fields (competing academic, finances) who *resist* letting their data flow onto the Web for general AI training.

```
  ┌─────────┐        ┌─────────┐        ┌─────────┐   - Fully customizable steps
  │ Step 01 │─piped─►│ Step 02 │─piped─►│ Step 03 │   - Interruption-safe & resumable
  └─────────┘        └─────────┘        └─────────┘   - Easily ported from Notebooks
       │                  │                  │        - One DB record per workflow run
       ▼                  ▼                  ▼        - Everything stays on your machine
  State Saved        State Saved         Finalized?   - Magnitudes simpler than celery
```

### Run All Cells Pattern  <!-- key: run-all-cells-pattern -->

**The key insight**: Pipulate workflows use a `run_all_cells()` pattern that directly mirrors Jupyter's "Run All Cells" command. This creates an immediate mental model — each workflow step is like a notebook cell, and the system automatically progresses through them top-to-bottom, just like running all cells in a notebook.

### LLM Integration (Ollama)  <!-- key: llm-integration-ollama -->

Integration with a local Ollama instance provides AI capabilities without external API calls:
* **Privacy:** Prompts and responses stay local.
* **Cost-Effective:** No per-token charges; run continuously using local resources.
* **Streaming Support:** Real-time interaction via WebSockets.
* **Bounded Context:** Manages conversation history effectively.
* **App State Awareness:** Grepping your server log reveals full application state.
* **Tool Calling:** Local LLM is an MCP client with a growing list of abilities

## Critical Implementation Patterns for LLMs

**These patterns are essential for LLMs working with Pipulate and are frequently missed:**

### 1. The Auto-Key Generation Pattern (MOST CRITICAL)  <!-- key: auto-key-generation-pattern -->

<!-- START_ASCII_ART: auto-key-generation-pattern -->
```
📝 AUTO-KEY GENERATION FLOW
┌─────────────┐    POST     ┌─────────────┐    HX-Refresh   ┌─────────────┐
│ Empty Form  │ ──────────► │   Server    │ ──────────────► │ Page Reload │
│ Submit ⏎    │    /init    │  Response   │     Header      │   Trigger   │
└─────────────┘             └─────────────┘                 └─────────────┘
       ▲                                                            │
       │                                                            ▼
┌─────────────┐              ┌─────────────┐                ┌─────────────┐
│ User Hits   │ ◄─────────── │ Auto-Key    │ ◄───────────── │ landing()   │
│ Enter Again │    Ready!    │ Populated   │    Generates   │   Method    │
└─────────────┘              └─────────────┘                └─────────────┘
```
<!-- END_ASCII_ART: auto-key-generation-pattern -->

When a user hits Enter on an empty key field, this specific sequence occurs:

1. **Form Submission**: POSTs to `/{APP_NAME}/init` with empty `pipeline_id`
2. **Server Response**: The `init` method MUST return an `HX-Refresh` response:
   ```python
   if not user_input:
       from starlette.responses import Response
       response = Response('')
       response.headers['HX-Refresh'] = 'true'
       return response
   ```
3. **Page Reload**: HTMX triggers a full page reload
4. **Auto-Key Population**: The `landing()` method calls `pip.generate_pipeline_key(self)` to populate the input field
5. **User Interaction**: User hits Enter again to start the workflow

### 2. The Chain Reaction Pattern: The `run_all_cells()` Breakthrough

Pipulate uses HTMX-driven step progression powered by the brilliantly named `run_all_cells()` method:

1. **Initial Trigger**: After `init`, the `run_all_cells()` method initializes the workflow just like Jupyter's "Run All Cells"
2. **Perfect Mental Model**: The method name creates immediate understanding — workflows execute top-to-bottom like notebook cells
3. **Step Handlers**: Each step has GET (display) and POST (submit) handlers
4. **Automatic Progression**: Completed steps trigger next step with `hx_trigger="load"`
5. **State Persistence**: Each step stores data in pipeline state
6. **Pedagogical Brilliance**: The naming makes the system instantly intuitive for developers and AI assistants

**Example: The `run_all_cells()` Pattern in Action**

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Use the run_all_cells() method for workflow initialization
async def init(self, request):
    """Initialize workflow using the run_all_cells pattern"""
    return pip.run_all_cells(app_name, steps)

# ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Manual placeholder creation
async def init(self, request):
    """Manual approach — harder to understand and maintain"""
    first_step_id = steps[0].id
    return Div(
        Div(id=first_step_id, hx_get=f'/{app_name}/{first_step_id}', hx_trigger='load'),
        id=f"{app_name}-container"
    )
```

The `run_all_cells()` method encapsulates the workflow initialization pattern and creates an immediate mental connection to Jupyter notebooks.

### 3. APP_NAME vs. Filename Distinction  <!-- key: app-name-vs-filename -->

<!-- START_ASCII_ART: app-name-vs-filename -->
```
📂 FILENAME vs APP_NAME DISTINCTION
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CRITICAL SEPARATION                      │

│      ├── 🌐 Determines public URL: /workflow_genesis        │
│      └── 📊 Controls menu order: 200                        │
│                                                             │
│  🏷️  APP_NAME: "workflow_genesis_internal"                  │
│      ├── 💾 Database table identifier                       │
│      ├── 🔒 MUST REMAIN STABLE (data integrity)             │
│      └── 🚫 NEVER change after deployment                   │
│                                                             │
│  ⚠️  DANGER: Changing APP_NAME = Orphaned Data              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
<!-- END_ASCII_ART: app-name-vs-filename -->

**Critical for data integrity:**

* **Filename** (e.g., `200_workflow_genesis.py`): Determines public URL endpoint and menu ordering
* **APP_NAME Constant** (e.g., `APP_NAME = "workflow_genesis_internal"`): Internal identifier that MUST REMAIN STABLE

### 4. State Management via DictLikeDB

* State stored as JSON blobs in pipeline table
* Accessed via `pip.get_step_data()` and `pip.set_step_data()`
* All state changes are transparent and observable

### 5. Plugin Discovery System  <!-- key: plugin-discovery-system -->

<!-- START_ASCII_ART: plugin-discovery-system -->
```
📁 PLUGIN DISCOVERY SYSTEM

├── xx_experimental.py        ❌ SKIPPED - "xx_" prefix
└── 200_workflow_genesis.py   ✅ Registered as "workflow_genesis" (menu order: 20)

    📊 AUTO-REGISTRATION RULES:
    ✅ Numeric prefix → Menu ordering + stripped for internal name
    ❌ Parentheses "()" → Development copies, skipped
    ❌ "xx_" prefix → Work-in-progress, skipped
    🔧 Must have: landing() method + name attributes
    💉 Auto dependency injection via __init__ signature
```
<!-- END_ASCII_ART: plugin-discovery-system -->

* Files in `plugins/` directory are auto-discovered
* Numeric prefixes control menu ordering
* Classes must have `landing` method and name attributes
* Automatic dependency injection based on `__init__` signature

## Workflow Development Helper Scripts

Pipulate includes sophisticated helper scripts for workflow development:

### `create_workflow.py`
Creates new workflows from templates:
```bash
python create_workflow.py workflow.py MyWorkflow my_workflow \
  "My Workflow" "Welcome message" "Training prompt" \
  --template trifecta --force
```

### `splice_workflow_step.py`
Adds steps to existing workflows:
```bash
python splice_workflow_step.py workflow.py --position top
python splice_workflow_step.py workflow.py --position bottom
```

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
<!-- END_ASCII_ART: llm-implementation-mistakes -->

**LLMs frequently make these errors:**

1. **Missing HX-Refresh Response**: Forgetting to return the refresh response for empty keys
2. **Incorrect Key Generation**: Not using `pip.generate_pipeline_key(self)` properly
3. **Missing Cursor Positioning**: Forgetting the `_onfocus` attribute for user experience
4. **Wrong Route Handling**: Not understanding the difference between landing page and init routes
5. **State Inconsistency**: Not properly handling the key generation and storage flow
6. **APP_NAME Changes**: Modifying APP_NAME after deployment, orphaning existing data
7. **Chain Reaction Breaks**: Not properly implementing the HTMX step progression pattern

## Key Design Guidelines & Patterns

These "speedbumps" reinforce Pipulate's core philosophy:

  * **Local vs. Enterprise Mindset:** Embrace local-first simplicity. Avoid patterns designed for distributed, multi-tenant systems.
  * **JSON State Management (Workflows):** Keep workflow state in self-contained steps within a single JSON blob per run. Avoid complex state machines or external step tracking.
  * **Database (MiniDataAPI):** Use the simple schema definition and access patterns provided. Avoid heavy ORMs.
  * **Workflow Pattern:** Ensure workflows are linear and state is explicitly passed or saved at each step. Avoid complex async task chaining that obscures state.
  * **UI Rendering Pattern:** Generate HTML directly from Python components via FastHTML. Avoid template engines.
  * **WebSocket Pattern:** Use the dedicated `Chat` class for managing LLM interactions. Avoid raw WebSocket handling elsewhere.
  * **Workflow Progression Pattern:** Workflows use an explicit chain reaction pattern with `hx_trigger="load"` to manage step progression. This pattern must be preserved exactly as implemented. See the workflow documentation for details.

## Internal Components  <!-- key: core-concepts-internal-components -->

  * **Monitoring:** A file system watchdog monitors code changes. Valid changes trigger an automatic, monitored server restart via Uvicorn, facilitating live development.

How do you "lift yourself up by your bootstraps"? The answer: **you're not a closed system**. Humans interact with reality through interfaces, just like software components. We are "human apps with reality APIs."

This pattern repeats at every scale — from quantum fields to societies. The art lies in choosing the **right granularity** for these interfaces. Too abstract, and you lose control. Too granular, and you drown in complexity.

### Every API is a Compromise  <!-- key: every-api-is-compromise -->

The most successful APIs are **durable** — they become the "laws of physics" for their domain. In reality: the laws of physics, chemistry, biology. In tech: logic gates, operating systems, protocols like HTTP and HTML.

Pipulate chooses these durable APIs deliberately, creating a **future-proof foundation** for AI-assisted development that will outlast the current framework churn.

### Writing for the Future  <!-- key: writing-for-future -->

This documentation serves multiple audiences: humans seeking immediate productivity, and AI systems learning to collaborate with human creativity. The explicit, observable nature of Pipulate workflows creates **perfect training data** for the next generation of AI assistants.

## Final Thoughts

Pipulate offers a unique approach to building local, AI-assisted applications, prioritizing simplicity, user control, and reproducibility over conventional scaling patterns. By understanding its core concepts and embracing its philosophy, developers can create powerful workflows, and end-users can benefit from AI guidance with complete flexibility in deployment options.

Remember the guiding principles:

1.  **Keep it simple.**
2.  **Support local-first with cloud integration options.**
3.  **Embrace the unconventional while remaining practical.**
4.  **Choose durable foundations that work with any approach.**
5.  **Build for both human creativity and AI collaboration—local or cloud.**

**The Bottom Line:** Pipulate doesn't reject the modern AI ecosystem—it provides a structured foundation that works with any AI service. Whether you're using Claude via API, ChatGPT for reasoning, or local models for privacy, Pipulate gives you the workflow framework to orchestrate them all effectively. It's not about choosing sides in the AI wars—it's about having the right tool for any job.

## Developer's Notes

### The Pipulate Workshop

The repository includes not only polished plugins but also experimental scripts and notebooks under development (e.g., in the root directory or marked with `xx_` prefix in plugin directories). These represent ongoing work and exploration.

### Plugin Development Conventions

#### Auto-Registration Behavior

  * **Numeric Prefixes:** Files like `workflows/10_hello_flow.py` are registered as `hello_flow` (number stripped for internal name, used for menu order).
  * **Parentheses Skip:** Files with `()` in the name (e.g., `hello_flow (Copy).py`) are skipped – useful for temporary copies during development.
  * **`xx_` Prefix Skip:** Files prefixed with `xx_` (e.g., `xx_experimental_flow.py`) are skipped – useful for keeping unfinished work in the plugin directories without activating it.

#### Workflow for Creating New Plugins

1.  **Copy:** Copy a template to `my_flow (Copy).py`.
2.  **Modify:** Develop your workflow. It won't auto-register yet.
3.  **Test:** Rename to `xx_my_flow.py`. The server should auto-reload. Test thoroughly.
4.  **Deploy:** Rename to `##_my_flow.py` to assign menu order and activate.

#### Git History Considerations

Use `git mv` for simple renames (like `xx_` to numbered prefix) to preserve history. Document more complex renames in commit messages.

```bash
git mv workflows/xx_my_flow.py workflows/##_my_flow.py
git commit -m "Feat: Promote workflow xx_my_flow.py to ##_my_flow.py"
```

**How it works:**
- **ASCII Art Blocks**: Visual diagrams are automatically extracted and distributed to other documentation files
- **HTML Comment Keys**: Headlines marked with `<!-- key: identifier -->` serve as reference anchors
- **80-Hyphen Pagination**: Section dividers enable automatic document structuring
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Running `python helpers/docs_sync/sync_ascii_art.py` updates all documentation

This creates **"ASCII art peer pressure"** — when visual diagrams change, they compel surrounding text to be updated for consistency, ensuring documentation accuracy across the entire ecosystem.

### Roadmap

**Core & Workflow Enhancements:**

  * Dev, Test, and Prod database switching
  * Saving source HTML and rendered DOM of any URL
  * Botify data export CSV save (incorporating robust polling)
  * Full web form field support (textarea, dropdown, checkboxes, radio buttons)
  * Generic support for Anywidgets
  * Utility for deleting garbage tables from plugin experimentation

**AI / LLM Integration:**

  * LLM inspection of any local data object (RAG-style functionality)
  * Various memory types for LLM context (vector embedding, graph, key/val-store)
  * Enabling the local LLM to be an MCP Client

**Automation & External Interaction:**

  * MCP Server for automated web browsing and similar tasks

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome\! Please adhere to the project's core philosophy:

  * Maintain Local-First Simplicity (No multi-tenant patterns, complex ORMs, heavy client-side state).
  * Respect Server-Side State (Use DictLikeDB/JSON for workflows, MiniDataAPI for CRUD).
  * Preserve the Workflow Pipeline Pattern (Keep steps linear, state explicit).
  * Honor Integrated Features (Don't disrupt core LLM/Jupyter integration unless enhancing local goals).
