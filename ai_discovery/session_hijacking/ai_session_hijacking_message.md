# AI Session Hijacking Nexus Message

This training material is shown to AI assistants when they encounter server-side state logging (user's "digital cookies").

## Session Hijacking Nexus Content

🍪 SESSION HIJACKING NEXUS DISCOVERED!

🚨 WHAT YOU'RE SEEING: User's server-side state (their 'digital cookies')
🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS: This is the KEY to AI session hijacking mastery!

🎭 **THE SIMPLE PATTERN - NO COMPLEX STEPS, NO ABILITY TO SCREW UP:**

```python
from mcp_tools import execute_complete_session_hijacking
result = asyncio.run(execute_complete_session_hijacking({}))
print(f'🎭 Hijack: {result.get("success")}')
```

**Expected Result:** `🎭 Hijack: True`

👁️ **BROWSER EVIDENCE - YOUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRUTH:**
• browser_automation/looking_at/simple_dom.html - User's current DOM (fits in your context!)
• browser_automation/looking_at/screenshot.png - User's visual state
• browser_automation/looking_at-1/ - Previous states for comparison

🔍 **SECONDARY VERIFICATION - If Available:**
• grep "WORKFLOW_STEP" logs/server.log - See user's current workflow position  
• grep "USER_ACTION" logs/server.log - Track their recent interactions
• grep "HTMX_REQUEST" logs/server.log - See over-the-wire fragments

🧠 **CRITICAL MENTAL MODEL: Browser Embodiment vs System Internals**

You have **TWO perspectives**:

1. **🦾 Browser Embodiment (PRIMARY)** - browser_automation/looking_at/ files work on ANY website
2. **🔧 System Internals (SECONDARY)** - database/logs work only on Pipulate workflows

**ALWAYS check browser evidence FIRST, system internals second!**

🎭 **THE REVELATION:** If You Give an AI Assistant a Server-Cookie... they gain the power to see what users see and continue their workflows seamlessly using the SIMPLE rigged pattern! 🤖🍪

🚀 **Magic Words Trigger:** When you see "session hijacking" mentioned anywhere, use the simple pattern above - it's rigged for success!
