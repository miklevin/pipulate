At every scale of reality, we see the same pattern: **"lumps of stuff" with APIs** that enable interaction. Quarks combine into atoms, atoms into molecules, cells into organisms, individuals into societies. Each level requires the right **granularity** of interface - not so abstract that you lose control, not so granular that you drown in complexity.

**This is the 80/20 rule of existence:** Handle 80% of interactions gracefully with 20% of the API surface, then handle edge cases as needed. Pipulate applies this principle to code architecture.
