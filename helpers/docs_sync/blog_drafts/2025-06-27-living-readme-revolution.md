excerpt: "Transform README.md into a narrative-driven, parsable source of truth where ASCII art blocks can be extracted and distributed as atomic units across documentation."

What if your README.md could be more than just documentation? What if every ASCII art diagram could be a **parsable, distributable asset** that maintains consistency across your entire project?

The Living README system transforms documentation from static text into a **dynamic source of truth** where visual elements become first-class citizens in your documentation ecosystem.

### The Parsing Strategy

Each ASCII art block follows a structured format that enables automatic extraction and distribution:

```
### Headline (becomes the title/key)
Header content
```
ASCII art content
```
Footer content
```

### The Distribution Revolution

**Source**: README.md (clean, beautiful, GitHub-friendly)  
**Destinations**: Any .md/.mdc file with markers

This creates a "foolproof failsafe" single source of truth for all ASCII art across the entire Pipulate ecosystem, enabling documentation that writes itself.
