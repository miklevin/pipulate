The tech industry suffers from "hamster wheel syndrome" - constantly breaking APIs that force migration cycles. React (20+ versions), Node (frequent breaking changes), Angular (complete rewrites). This isn't progress; it's planned obsolescence.

**Pipulate chooses durable foundations:**
- **Linux Kernel**: Version 6 in 30 years
- **Python**: Version 3 in 30 years  
- **HTML**: Version 5 and stable
- **HTTP**: Version 3 and backward compatible

These are the "laws of physics" for software - stable APIs that enable compound growth rather than constant rebuilding.
