**üîß FINDER_TOKEN: MCP_CONSOLIDATION_PROGRESS**

The consolidation of all MCP tools from `server.py` into `mcp_tools.py` represents a major architectural improvement for AI assistant interaction and code organization.

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: 8 Tools + Helper Functions (40%)

**Core Tools**
- `pipeline_state_inspector` - The debugging game changer
- `botify_ping` - API connectivity test
- `local_llm_read_file` - File content reading
- `local_llm_grep_logs` - Log searching with FINDER_TOKENs

### ‚è≥ REMAINING: 12 Tools

**Browser Automation Tools (Critical)**
- `browser_scrape_page` - AI EYES - Primary sensory interface
- `browser_automate_workflow_walkthrough` - AI HANDS - Action interface
- `browser_interact_with_current_page` - Interactive control

**Botify API Tools (Advanced)**
- `botify_get_full_schema` - Schema discovery (4,449+ fields)
- `botify_execute_custom_bql_query` - Advanced BQL execution

### üöÄ ARCHITECTURAL BENEFITS

**For AI Assistants**
- Single source of truth for all MCP tools
- Better organization by functionality
- Easier discovery and documentation

**For Developers**
- Cleaner architecture with separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance with changes in one place
- Better testing with isolated tool testing

**For System Performance**
- Reduced duplication - no duplicate function definitions
- Optimized imports and better dependency management
- Cleaner registration with single registration point

### The Path Forward

The foundation is solid. The remaining work is systematic tool migration, focusing first on the critical browser automation tools that provide AI assistants with "eyes and hands" in the system.
