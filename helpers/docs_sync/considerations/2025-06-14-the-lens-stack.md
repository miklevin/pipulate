Pipulate's technology choices form **aligned lenses** that focus ideas from abstraction to actualization. Each lens must be **ground and polished** without misaligning the focus:

```
Linux/Nix ──► HTTP ──► HTML ──► HTMX ──► Python ──► Git
(Hardware)   (Protocol) (Structure) (Interaction) (Logic) (Persistence)
```

**Nix serves as the "Noah's Ark"** - preserving this perfect focus in a reproducible environment that works identically across all platforms. Once you've locked in the focus, it lasts for years or decades, all bottled up in infrastructure-as-code.
