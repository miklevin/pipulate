    "The entire world of technology hinges on this [data pipelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) concept. Details will vary from tech system to system, particularly how persistence is achieved. People rarely frame it this way but Notebooks are popular in part because of how well they *pipe* the output of one cell so intuitively and naturally into the input of the next cell — chaining them up into a data pipeline driven workflow uniquely suited for the fields of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) and [finance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ygPF-Qshkc). This piping of data concept is so important that we have made the Hello World of data piping into a [core feature of Pipulate](http://localhost:5001/hello_workflow).\n",

It is a lifetime of learning, but this Notebook is only trying to do so much. we'll give ***further reading*** links where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **This is a Notebook**: Notebooks, aka *Jupyter Notebook*, deliberately mix documentation (like this) and code. That's a large part of the point. The concept is called [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), coined by Donald Knuth but brought to you in modern times by [Fernando Pérez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_P%C3%A9rez_(software_developer))\n",
    "2. **Cell-by-cell run**: The way code executes in a Notebook is unique. Each cell can be run individually instead of the more typical **all at once** way (with more traditional `.py` files). The concept is [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop), coined by L. Peter Deutsch and Edmund Berkeley.\n",
    "3. **Platform**: Many things run Notebooks, like Google Colab, but they do not run them the exact same way. There is still an underlying platform / environment / context:\n",
    "   - Cloud vs. Local\n",
    "   - If local, host system vs. virtual environment/subsystem\n",
    "4. **Nix**: The way Notebooks are running here is local with a Linux [Nix](https://nixos.org/) subsystem.\n",
    "5. **Leading edge**: You are on the edge here. Most people are going to do this kind of work out on the cloud to make it easy-as-possible — but that's full of limits, privacy concerns and hidden costs. Pipulate makes the increased price of free & local (complexity) as gentle as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Free Software\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not paying for the product, then you are the product — **this is not true.** *Genuine altruism exists in this world starting with GNU and the FSF* (Free Software Foundation) behind Linux and many of the other components of the Pipulate system. That expression has had the unfortunate effect over the years of steering people away from the underlying technology stack that everyone providing the paid-for or advertising-subsidized service builds on in the first place. The price of true freedom (as in liberty) is complexity, but it is becoming easier thanks to tools like Nix.\n",

For example, table-joins across Collections are a thing—demonstrated here as `search_console` joined with `crawl.YYMMDD`, left-outer if I'm reading it correctly (I may have to amend that).

Such reports help identify potential deep crawl issues, spider-traps, and why (in addition to the infinite spam-cannon of generative AI content), brute-force crawls that *\"make a copy of the Internet\"* are all but dead. And did I mention that excessively crawl-able faceted search makes your site's link-graph look like the Death Star? Yeah, I think I did."

    "**Rationale**: This depth distribution shows how many URLs exist at each click depth level from the homepage (hompage = depth 0). A healthy site typically has most content within 3 or 4 clicks of the homepage. Much more, and it may as well not exist. Such reports help identify potential deep crawl issues, spider-traps, and why (in addition to the infinite spam-cannon of generative AI content), brute-force crawls that *\"make a copy of the Internet\"* are all but dead. And did I mention that excessively crawl-able faceted search makes your site's link-graph look like the Death Star? Yeah, I think I did."

In fact, needing to write this prompt rather proves the opposite... wait, did I just create a paradox? Anyway, there's a very subtle chicken-and-egg problem that this file in general and this example in particular helps address: ***validation of collection fields*** so you can template automations without them being too fragile."

    "**Rationale**: BQL and enterprise SEO diagnostics provide powerful tools for comprehensive website analysis. This code transforms link structures into detailed visualizations of your site's SEO health, presenting search signals and performance metrics in a multi-dimensional view. Similar to how diagnostic imaging reveals underlying conditions, these analyses expose strengths, vulnerabilities, and technical issues within your site architecture. Prepare your site for the increasing number of AI crawlers by optimizing your content and structure. Ensure your schema.org structured data is properly implemented to support real-time crawls that evaluate product availability and other critical information.\n",

    "3. **Metrics**\n",
    "   - Convert aggregation metrics to appropriate BQLv2 metric fields\n",
    "   - Use empty array when no metrics needed\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Filters**\n",

    "# Jupyter Notebook Self-Export and Custom Markdown Processing Script\n",
    "# -------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "# Purpose:\n",
    "# This script, when run as a cell in a Jupyter Notebook, automates the conversion\n",
    "# of the notebook itself into a clean, well-structured Markdown (.md) file.\n",
    "# The process involves two main stages:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. Self-Export to Raw Markdown:\n",
    "#    - The script first identifies the current Jupyter Notebook file.\n",
    "#    - It then uses 'jupyter nbconvert' to convert the notebook into a standard\n",
    "#      Markdown file, saved in the same directory as the notebook.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2. Custom Post-Processing with Heading-Based Delineators:\n",
    "#    - The script then applies a custom processing function to this Markdown file.\n",
    "#    - This custom processing includes:\n",
    "#      a. Removing any YAML frontmatter (text between '---' markers at the\n",
    "#         very start of the document).\n",
    "#      b. Inserting a wide visual delineator (80 hyphens with surrounding\n",
    "#         blank lines) *before* every H1 Markdown heading (`# Heading`)\n",
    "#         that is not inside a fenced code block. This leverages the semantic\n",
    "#         structure of headings for separation.\n",
    "#      c. Prepending a global header (currently configured to be blank).\n",
    "#    - The processed content is then saved. If an optional hardwired output path\n",
    "#      is specified, the final file goes there; otherwise, it overwrites the\n",
    "#      initial Markdown file in the notebook's directory. This results in a\n",
    "#      single .md file named after the original notebook, with clear section\n",
    "#      delineations.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Rationale:\n",
    "# This workflow produces LLM-ready Markdown. The H1-triggered delineators\n",
    "# enhance readability and provide strong parsing cues for segmenting content\n",
    "# based on major sections (as typically denoted by H1s). This approach relies\n",
    "# on the semantic use of H1 headings in the notebook's Markdown cells to create\n",
    "# logical breaks, offering a more content-aware separation than generic\n",
    "# between-cell markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- Configuration: Optional Hardwired Output Path ---\n",
    "# Set this to a specific directory path (e.g., \"/path/to/your/output_folder\" or \"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\output\")\n",
    "# if you want the final Markdown file to always be saved there.\n",
    "# If None or an empty string, the Markdown file will be saved in the same\n",
    "# directory as the Jupyter Notebook (original behavior).\n",
    "# IMPORTANT: If providing a path, ensure the script has write permissions to it.\n",
    "#            The script will attempt to create the directory if it doesn't exist.\n",
