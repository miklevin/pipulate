Bulletproof Surgeon v2.0 - Guardian Framework for Code Surgery

Built from the wisdom of surgical failures, this orchestrator includes:
- Path discipline validation (learned from workspace root violations)
- Copy vs Move verification (learned from duplication disasters)  
- Pre/post surgical state validation (learned from false success testing)
- Atomic operations with rollback (learned from Frankenstein codebases)
- Defensive programming against all edge cases

The Roomba Algorithm Enhanced: Back up, turn a little, try again - but with BULLETPROOF safeguards.
