Enhanced Server Refactor Demo - Order Dependency Vulnerability Detection

This demonstrates the enhanced surgical system that addresses the critical vulnerabilities 
identified by the user:
- Global assignments that depend on functions (logger = setup_logging())
- Imports/comments sitting between functions (ASCII imports)
- Configuration clusters that must stay together (APP_NAME, DB_FILENAME)
- Conditional execution blocks with global dependencies

The enhanced system is CONSERVATIVE by design - when in doubt, keep it together!
