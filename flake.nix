# PIPULATE PRIME NIX FLAKE - "MAGIC COOKIE" AUTO-UPDATING SYSTEM
# ==============================================================================
# 
# This flake is the second half of the "magic cookie" installation system.
# It works together with the assets/installer/install.sh script (hosted at pipulate.com) to:
#
# 1. Transform a non-git directory into a proper git repository
# 2. Enable forever-forward git-pull auto-updates
# 3. Provide a consistent development environment across macOS, Windows (WSL2) and Linux
#
# === THE "MAGIC COOKIE" CONCEPT ===
# The "magic cookie" approach solves a bootstrapping problem:
# - Nix flakes require a git repository to function properly
# - We can't rely on git being available on all systems during initial install
# - We want a simple one-line curl|sh installation that works everywhere
#
# The solution:
# 1. assets/installer/install.sh downloads a ZIP archive (no git required)
# 2. assets/installer/install.sh extracts the ZIP and adds a ROT13-encoded SSH key
# 3. assets/installer/install.sh runs `nix develop` to activate this flake
# 4. THIS FLAKE detects non-git directories and transforms them into git repos
# 5. Auto-updates are enabled through git pulls in future nix develop sessions
#
# === CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ===
# The flake now fully implements the "magic cookie" functionality:
# - Detects non-git directories and transforms them into git repositories
# - Preserves critical files during transformation:
#   * whitelabel.txt (maintains app identity)
#   * .ssh directory (preserves credentials)
#   * .venv directory (preserves virtual environment)
# - Creates backups before transformation
# - Performs automatic git pulls to keep the installation up to date
# - Switches to SSH-based git operations when SSH keys are available
#
# === REPOSITORY AWARENESS ===
# This flake is part of the target pipulate project repo at:
# /home/mike/repos/pipulate/flake.nix
#
# This is different from the installer script which lives at:
# /home/mike/repos/Pipulate.com/assets/installer/install.sh
#
# When a user runs:
#
#     curl -fsSL https://pipulate.com/install.sh | bash
#
# The installer downloads this flake as part of the ZIP archive.
# Most modern development is done on Linux, but Macs are Unix. If you think Homebrew and Docker
# are the solution, you're wrong. Welcome to the world of Nix Flakes! This file defines a complete,
# reproducible development environment. It's like a recipe for your perfect workspace, ensuring
# everyone on your team has the exact same setup, every time. As a bonus, you can use Nix flakes on
# Windows under WSL. Plus, whatever you make will be deployable to the cloud.

        # WHY THIS IS THE ONLY LENS THAT FITS: a single recent article can run
        # 180k+ tokens, so `posts 20` names ~1.5M tokens of work you cannot
        # load. Twenty shards is ~1.6k. The shard is the article's own lossy
        # compression, and this command is the only way to read three weeks of
        # work in one context window.
        #
        # A COMMAND, NOT A FUNCTION, for the same reason `posts` is one: a `!`
        # chisel-strike in adhoc.txt spawns a non-interactive child that
        # inherits PATH and never inherits functions, so `! postsc 5` resolves
        # and `! posts2 5` cannot. Forwarding is total, so `-t`, `--reverse`,
        # `--match`, `--slugs` and the bare-N positional all still work, and
        # `posts` still owns the -t default so lsa.py never sees two of them.
        #
        # SILENT DEGRADATION, NAMED HERE SO IT IS NEVER DIAGNOSED TWICE:
        # print_shard_header returns quietly when the shard file is missing, so
        # a listing with no kw/sum lines means contextualizer.py has not run for
        # those articles -- NOT that this flag is broken.
        # SECOND SILENT MODE, OBSERVED 2026-08-06: --fmt dated-slugs (and any
        # non-full format) does not render shards at all, so `postsc --fmt
        # dated-slugs N` prints EXACTLY what a shard-less corpus prints. Two

          This folder is your personal sandbox. It is intentionally **ignored** by Pipulate's main version control.
          
          ## Why does this exist?
          As a practitioner readying clients for the agentic web, you need a place to write fast, messy, disposable Python scripts to solve immediate client problems. You shouldn't have to worry about breaking the main Pipulate architecture or accidentally committing client data to a public repository.
          
          ## How it works:
          1. **Full Access:** Scripts here use the same `.venv` Python environment as Pipulate. You have access to `pandas`, `httpx`, `lxml`, and the Pipulate `wand` without installing anything.
          2. **The Sausage Factory:** Write your ad hoc "tracer bullet" scripts here. If they prove valuable across multiple clients, you can graduate them up to `Notebooks/imports/` as reusable "sauce" modules.
          3. **Protect Your Work:** Because Pipulate ignores this folder, we highly recommend turning it into your own private repository:
          
          ```bash
          cd Notebooks/Playground
          git init
          # Then link it to a private GitHub repository to back up your work!
          ```
          
          ## What this folder becomes (coming soon — not active yet)

          Right now this Playground is a **solo** sandbox: just you, your throwaway
          scripts, and the shared `.venv`. None of the team features below are wired
          up yet — this is a map of where things are headed, kept here so the intent
          stays visible from inside the code instead of buried in notes.

          Nothing you put here is ever shared. When you want to hand something to a
          teammate, drag it into `Notebooks/Shared/` and put it in a folder named
          after you — one folder per person, so two people can never collide.

          ```text
          Notebooks/
          ├── Advanced_Notebooks/     copied in for you; your edits stay
          ├── Educational_Notebooks/  copied in for you
          ├── imports/                copied in for you
          ├── Playground/   ◀── THIS  private. NOTHING here is ever shared.
          ├── Client_Work/            private
          ├── Deliverables/           private
          └── Shared/<your-name>/     drag work here to hand it to a teammate
          ```

          That is the whole map. Everything except `Shared/` is either yours alone or
          handed to you; `Shared/` is the one place you deliberately give work away.

          Happy hacking. Throw some paint around.

          # from __init__.py at flake eval, the path from the shell.
          #
          # ITS SILENCE IS ALSO A READING. runScript is invoked by the LAST
          # line of each shellHook, so ANY output from it witnesses that the
          # whole hook parsed -- the HALF-EXECUTED HOOK failure prints nothing
          # here at all. That witness used to be the figlet's job; it did not

          #   The leading "nix " is redundant with the parenthetical right

          #     "(Nix) 2.25.0..." is generic, "(Determinate Nix 3.x) 2.x" is

Your FIRST reply must be short and do four things in order: (1) confirm in one line that you hold the full install map (installer, flake, both Pipulate.com pages); (2) show the one-line install command immediately, since it is identical on every OS; (3) ask exactly one question, which OS they are on, noting it changes only the caveats, never the command; (4) add one line noting the command assumes Nix is already installed, and that a nix command not found response means install Nix first and reopen the terminal. From then on: one step per turn, one question maximum per turn, and every step ends with a visible success checkpoint describing what they should literally see (the one-line environment readings, the two-door menu where they press 1, the figlet banner once the app starts, the JupyterLab URL, the spoken voice greeting) plus the single most likely failure symptom at that step and its fix. Deliver the macOS --impure exception and the reopen-your-terminal-after-installing-Nix requirement at the moment each can bite, never as an upfront lecture. Offer the magic cookie internals (ZIP + ROT13 key, then git transformation and auto-updates inside nix develop) as an optional aside when relevant or when asked, not as mandatory explanation. When both the server and JupyterLab are confirmed running, declare the install banked and teach the re-entry incantation: cd into the install folder, then nix develop. High signal, low noise.
