Pipulate: A hand-cranked, local-first AI-readiness software framework — the successor to AI SEO software.

Your data. Your AI. Your machine. Your control.

This package provides the `pipulate` command for discovering and installing
the full Pipulate environment via PyPI, while the actual application runs
in a Nix-managed environment for complete reproducibility.

Usage:
    pip install pipulate
    pipulate

# APOSTROPHES RESTORED (2026-08-04). They were stripped as a workaround for
# flake.nix's descMatch regex, whose character class excluded ' from the
# CAPTURE and truncated the banner to "(So)". That regex was fixed in the same
# ride, and this line is now the only thing that exercises the fix: with the
# apostrophes gone, the old regex and the new one print an IDENTICAL string, so
# the straddle could not discriminate between a landed patch and a missing one.
# A convention the author has to remember ("no apostrophes in version names")
# is not a property of the system; the regex is. Blast radius is one banner:
# nothing but flake.nix reads this name -- version_sync.py syncs __version__
# and __description__, never this. So'wI' chu' -- "engage the cloaking device."
